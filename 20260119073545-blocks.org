* Blocks

A pair of braces in a program forms a block that groups components of a program.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Test {                 // Start of class block
    public static void main(String[] args){     // Start of method block
            System.out.println("Welcom to Java!");
    }                                           // End of method block
}
#+END_SRC

** Class block
The outermost pair of curly braces ={}= defines the =class= *block* for the Test =class=.

Everything inside these braces belongs to the Test class.

** Method block
Inside the =class= block, there's a method called ~main~.

The ~main~ method is the entry point of *any* Java application.

The curly braces ={}= following ~public static void main(String[] args)~ define the =method= block.

Everything inside these braces belongs to the =main= *method*.
