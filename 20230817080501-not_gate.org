#+title: NOT Gate

The NOT gate has only *one* input signal.

The NOT gate takes that input signal and outputs a signal with the opposite binary state.

If the input signal is =ON=, a NOT gate outputs an =OFF= signal.
If the input signal is =OFF=, a NOT gate outputs an =ON= signal.

| INPUT | OUTPUT |
|-------+--------|
| ON    | OFF    |
| OFF   | ON     |
