#+title: Comments

* Comments

=Comments= can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.

They can also be used to *prevent* *execution* when testing *alternative* *code*.

We can use the following types.

** Single-line comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (~//~).

Any text between ~//~ and the end of the line is *ignored* by Java (will *not* *be* *executed*).

Example:
~// This is a Single-line comment~
~System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");~

** Multi-line comments
Multi-line comments start with ~/*~ and end with ~*/~.

Any text between ~/*~ and ~*/~ will be *ignored*.

Example:
~/* The code below will print the Welcome to Java message to the screen*/~
~System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");~
