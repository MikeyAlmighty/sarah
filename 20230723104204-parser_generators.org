#+title: Parser Generators

* Parser Generator
Tools that, when fed with a formal description of a language, produce parsers as their output.
This output is code that can then be compiled/interpreted and itself fed with source code as input to produce a syntax tree.

The majority of them use a [[id:442f412e-ad2d-4886-9fdb-b472369cf2cf][Context-free Grammar (CFG)]] as their input.
A CFG is a set of rules that describe how to form correct (valid according to the syntax) sentences in a language.

The most common notational formats of [[id:442f412e-ad2d-4886-9fdb-b472369cf2cf][CFGs]] are the [[id:d7dcf42b-9655-47f1-ac4d-03b22f20951c][Backus-Naur Form (BNF)]] or the  [[id:8774f03c-4625-4a38-ad10-ab5ac6bddae3][Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)]].
