#+title: Meddler-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Uses [[id:29235b07-ca3d-485e-b733-bf223a30b80e][Cryptanalysists]] to insert a meddler between two communication devices or applications to exchange their keys for secure communication.

The meddler replies as the user and then performs a key exchange with each party.

The users or systems *think* they communicate with each other, not the meddler.

These attacks allow the meddler to obtain login credentials and other sensitive information.
