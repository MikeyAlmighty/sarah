#+title: Link State Routing Protocol

Routers using a Link State Protocol take a more sophisticated approach to determining the best path to a network.

Link state protocols get their name because each router advertises the state of the link of each of its interfaces.

The information about each router is propagated to every other router on the autonomous system.

This means that every router on the system knows every detail about every other router in the system.

Each router then uses this much larger set of information and runs complicated algorithms against it to determine what the best path to any destination network might be.

Link state Routing protocols require more memory and processing power than [[id:5519215a-02b4-4d29-b20a-35357eb33c82][Distance Vector Protocols]].
