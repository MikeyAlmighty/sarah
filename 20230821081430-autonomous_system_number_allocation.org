#+title: Autonomous System Number Allocation

Numbers assigned to individual [[id:803de826-d5fd-4248-a5ab-e194ee6275a8][Autonomous Systems.]]

Just like [[id:1011a8fb-ad00-40bb-a1cc-4b53c9fedff0][IP Address]] ASNs are *32 bit* numbers, but unlike [[id:1011a8fb-ad00-40bb-a1cc-4b53c9fedff0][IP Addresses]] they're normally referred to as just a single decimal number instead of being split out into readable bits.
