#+title: Frame Check Sequence (FCS)

This is a *4-byte or 32-bit* number that represents a checksum value for the entire [[id:73b06fc5-e631-40ad-828f-741dd84bd15c][Ethernet Frame]].

=Checksum Value=: Calculated by a [[id:58e6ab2d-12c6-41bc-b099-95f5d199819a][CRC]].

The reason a =checksum= value is included in an [[id:73b06fc5-e631-40ad-828f-741dd84bd15c][ethernet frame]] is so that the receiving network interface can infer if it received *uncorrupted* data.
