#+title: Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Get a =digital certificate of trust= from an entity called a [[id:9de3d7ca-682d-44bf-8f69-ac6294632ef0][Certificate Authority]].

The certificate authority grants a *certificate* to your website.

Install the *certificate* on your =web server=.

That way, when users visit your site, they'll see the [[id:705397de-a5f6-4752-a198-6e83aa0e0711][HTTPS]]  in the URL instead of just HTTP.

* TLS Grants us:
1. Secure communication line (Protected transmitted data)
2. Ability to authenticate both parties communicating (Typically only server is authenticated by the client)
3. Integrity of communications (Checks to ensure message aren't lost or altered in transit)
