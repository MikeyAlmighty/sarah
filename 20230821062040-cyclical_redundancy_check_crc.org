#+title: Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC)

Concept for data integrity and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions.

A =CRC= is basically a mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data.

Anytime you perform a =CRC= against a set of data, you should end up with the *same* checksum number.
