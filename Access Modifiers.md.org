* Access Modifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: access-modifiers
:ID:       74120db4-8592-4599-b77b-2f219fd748c9
:END:
** Private
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: private
:END:
If a Base (Parent) Class has a =private= field, that field is *NOT*
available in the Sub (Child) Class.

** Protected
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: protected
:END:
=protected= fields/methods are accessible (exposed) for any Class within
the package. If a Class is in a =different= package it won't be able to
see the protected members of another Class (in a different Package).
*HOWEVER*: If a Class in a different package (Class B), extends a Class
(in a different package, Class A), =protected= members from say Class A
is available (exposed) within Class A's Sub classes.

=Class B  (package com.someB)= Which contains some protected methods
=Class A (package com.someA)=

=Class A1 extends Class A= (Now we can access protected members From
Class B)
