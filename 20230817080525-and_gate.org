#+title: AND Gate

The AND gate involves *two* input signals.

Having two input signals means there will be four possible combinations of input values.
The AND rule outputs an =ON= signal only when both the inputs are =ON=.

Otherwise, the output signal will be =OFF=.

| INPUT A | INPUT B | OUTPUT |
|---------+---------+--------|
| ON      | OFF     | OFF    |
| ON      | ON      | ON     |
| OFF     | ON      | OFF    |
| OFF     | OFF     | OFF    |
