Define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.
The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links.

Resolved [[id:85e75571-71a6-4f6a-a1ef-7dff5e8f784d][collision domain]] by [[id:26f788c9-d546-49cf-af57-a301461a5162][CSMA/CD]].

Uses [[id:5b075cfc-c900-4457-8811-27152afd5245][MAC Addresses]] to ensure that the data it sends has *both* an address for the machine that *sent* the transmission, as well as, the one that the transmission was *intended* for.

In this way, even on a network segment acting as a single [[id:85e75571-71a6-4f6a-a1ef-7dff5e8f784d][collision domain]], each node on that network knows when traffic is intended for it.
