* Reference Types

Refers to an ~object~ (an instance of a ~class~).
Unlike [[id:46582863-7f97-448d-bbc7-f7da4c1e7574][Primitive Types]] that hold their values in the *memory* where the variable is allocated, references do not hold the value of the object they refer to.

Instead, a ~reference~ *“points”* to an ~object~ by storing the memory address where the object is located, a concept referred to as a pointer.

(Unlike other languages, Java does not allow you to learn what the physical memory address is.
You can only use the reference to refer to the ~object~.)

- Primitive Types do *not* have methods
- Reference Types *do* have methods
- Reference Types can be assigned to ~null~
