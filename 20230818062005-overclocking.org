#+title: Overclocking

Exceed the number of clock cycles on your [[id:434b40ba-6fee-45ee-95e0-f8b79f751cdd][CPU]] on almost any device.

Increase the rate of your CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.

Overclocking a CPU’s frequency involves three variables:

- The =base CPU clock frequency=. (Often measured in GHz).
- The =Core frequency=. (calculated by multiplying the base frequency by the CPU core multipliers.)
- The =Core voltage=, which needs to be increased in small increments to meet the increasing power demand of the CPU during the overclocking process.
