#+title: OR Gate

The OR gate involves two input signals.

The OR rule outputs an =OFF= signal only when both the inputs are =OFF=.

Otherwise, the output signal will be =ON=.

| INPUT A | INPUT B | OUTPUT |
|---------+---------+--------|
| ON      | OFF     | ON     |
| ON      | ON      | ON     |
| OFF     | ON      | ON     |
| OFF     | OFF     | OFF    |
