* ~.substring()~

The method ~substring()~ also looks for =characters in a string=.

It *returns* parts of the *string*.

*** _Exam Trick_

It helps to think of indexes a bit differently for the ~substring~ methods.
Pretend the indexes are right *before* the character they would point to:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./assets/substring_indexing.png]]

Notice how the arrow with the =0= points to the character that would have ~index 0~.
The arrow with the =1= points between characters with indexes 0 and 1.

There are *seven* characters in the String.

Since Java uses *zero­based* indexes, this means the *last character* has an index of =6=.
The arrow with the =7= points immediately after this *last character*.

This will help you remember that ~endIndex~ doesn’t give an *out­of­bounds exception* when it is one past the end of the String.

*** Signature

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public String substring(int beginIndex)
public String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
#+END_SRC

There is an =optional= second parameter, which is the *end index* you want to stop at.

***** _Exam Trick_
Notice we said *stop at* rather than *include*.

This means the ~endIndex~ parameter is allowed to be *one past the end of the sequence* if you want to stop at the end of the sequence.

**** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
var name = "animals";

System.out.println(name.substring(3)); // mals
System.out.println(name.substring(name.indexOf('m'))); // mals
System.out.println(name.substring(3, 4)); // m
System.out.println(name.substring(3, 7)); // mals
System.out.println(name.substring(3, 3)); // empty string
System.out.println(name.substring(3, 2)); // exception
System.out.println(name.substring(3, 8)); // exception
#+END_SRC
