* Best Practice for Methods

| Best Practice                  | Why It’s Important                  | Key Takeaway                                                |
|--------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use descriptive names          | Improves readability                | Names should explain purpose                                |
| Keep methods short             | Easier to debug and maintain        | Follow single responsibility principle (SRP)                |
| Avoid side effects             | Makes methods predictable           | Use local variables instead of modifying global state       |
| Use comments for complex logic | Helps future developers             | Explain algorithms or business logic clearly                |
| Prefer static methods          | Reduces unnecessary object creation | Use static when method doesn’t depend on instance variables |
