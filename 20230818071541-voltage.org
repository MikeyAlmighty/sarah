#+title: Voltage

We refer to the *pressure* as =voltage=.

* Too much
Plugged in a *120v* appliance into a *220v* Outlet

Power comes bursting through and fries the charger.

* Too little
*220v* appliance plugged into *120v* outlet, It'll still get electricity, but *slowly*.

This would be similar to if a water tank was only half pressurized it will draw water but slowly,

In some cases though, this can deteriorate the performance of the device and cause damage in the long-term.
