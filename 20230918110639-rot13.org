#+title: ROT13

ROT13 is a simple letter [[id:8d11d9ca-6a1d-4e8c-af17-b197fb779baf][Substitution Cipher]] that replaces a letter with the =13th= letter after it
13 = half of the alphabet
This results in the =ROT13= cipher being an *inverse of itself*.
What this means is that you can recover the =plaintext= from =ciphertexts= by performing the *ROT13* operation on the =ciphertexts=.
