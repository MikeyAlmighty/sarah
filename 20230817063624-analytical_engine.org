#+title: Analytical Engine

The analytical engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer [[id:3ecc2e2b-e509-407c-9e9e-2c00616a83e6][Charles Babbage]].

Although it was never completed, the Analytical Engine would have had most of the basic elements of the present-day computer.

It had four components:
- Mill (corresponding to a modern ALU)
- Store (memory)
- Operator (control unit)
- Output (input/output).
