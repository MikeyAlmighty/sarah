* Accessing a Static Variable or Method

Accessing a =static= member is easy.

You just put the ~Class~ name before the =method= or =variable=

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Snake {
    public static long hiss = 2;
}
System.out.println(Snake.hiss); // 2
#+END_SRC

*** _Exam Trick_

Java doesn’t care that ~s~ happens to be ~null~. Since we are looking for a =static= variable, it doesn’t matter:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
Snake s = new Snake();
System.out.println(s.hiss); // s is a Snake
s = null;
System.out.println(s.hiss); // s is still a Snake
#+END_SRC

Remember to look at the ~reference~ type for a variable when you see a =static= ~method~ or ~variable~.
The exam creators will try to trick you into thinking a =NullPointerException= is thrown because the variable happens to be ~null~. Don’t be fooled!
