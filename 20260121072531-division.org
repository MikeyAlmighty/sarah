#+title: Division

* Division
When both operands of a *division* are ~integers~, the result of the *division* is the =quotient= and the =fractional= part is [[id:f7cae15a-54c2-4bda-ae51-b05f9c899a99][truncated]].
For example, ~5 / 2~ yields =2=, not =2.5=, and ~–5 / 2~ yields =–2=, not =–2.5=.

To perform a *floating-point division*, one of the operands must be a *floating-point* number.
For example, ~5.0 / 2~ yields =2.5=.
