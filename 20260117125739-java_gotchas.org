** Main Method Not Public

Q: "What will happen if the =main= method is *not* ~public~?"

A: If the =main= method is *not* declared =public=, the program *will* *compile* *successfully*, but it will fail at runtime.

The [[id:04940e87-2f3a-4932-8467-375199bcac29][JVM]] must be able to access the =main= method to start the program.

If =main= is *not* ~public~, the [[id:04940e87-2f3a-4932-8467-375199bcac29][JVM]] *cannot* call it.

** Missing Main Method

#+BEGIN_SRC java
Error: Main method not found in class MissingMain, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
#+END_SRC

** How does the JVM handle exceptions during runtime?

It uses the =exception= =handling= mechanism to *catch* or *propagate* exceptions (~try/catch~)

** What type of error occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected and actual data types
Compilation Error
