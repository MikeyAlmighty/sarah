Q: "What will happen if the main method is not public?"

A: If the =main= method is *not* declared =public=, the program *will* *compile* *successfully*, but it will fail at runtime.

The [[id:04940e87-2f3a-4932-8467-375199bcac29][JVM]] must be able to access the =main= method to start the program.

If main is not public, the JVM *cannot* call it.
