* Example Usage: ~javac packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java~

*** Options
~­cp <classpath>~ Location of classes needed to compile/run program

By default, the ~javac~ command places the compiled classes in the *same directory* as the source code.

It also provides an option to place the class files into a *different* directory.
The ~­d~ option specifies this *target* directory.

~javac ­d classes packagea/ClassA.java packageb/ClassB.java~ places the compiled classes into the *classes* directory.

** Running from another directory
~java ­cp classes packageb.ClassB~
