#+title: Connection-oriented Protocol

One that establishes a connection, and uses this to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted.

A connection at the transport layer implies that every segment of data sent is =acknowledged=, this way both ends of the connection always know which bits of data have definitely been delivered to the other side and which haven't.

=Connection-oriented protocols= are important because the internet is a vast and busy place and lots of things could go wrong while trying to get data from point *A* to point *B*.
