#+title: Baiting

Attack happens through actual physical contact

This is called baiting, which is used to entice the victim to do something.

For example, an attacker could just leave a USB drive somewhere in hopes that someone out there will plug it into their machine to see what's on it.
But they've just installed malware on their machine without even knowing it.
