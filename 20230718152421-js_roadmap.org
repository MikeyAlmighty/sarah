Used to *Install, Update and Manage packages* within your JavaScript projects.

Course: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0][NPM Crash Course]]
(Can show extra nice-to-knows on live project.)

* Node.js
- Framework which allows us to build applications in JavaScript *outside* of the Web browser.
I'll give a brief overview on =Node.js=.
(=Node.js= is quite a beefy subject but I can show you the subset of the framework we use at `impact.com`).

* Puppeteer
- Used for web automation/web crawling.
Provides tooling for *Headless* site interaction, navigation, screenshots, Element selection and more.
Docs: [[https://pptr.dev/][Puppeteer Docs]]

I'll give a demo/walkthrough of puppeteer.
(The docs are quite extensive, I think a live demo/walkthrough will help speed up the learning significantly).
