#+title: Named Constants

* Named Constants

An [[id:6530b478-d4a9-46e6-bcf3-5a98fef431c4][identifier]] that represents a *permanent* value.

The *value* of a =variable= may change during the execution of a program, but a named constant, or simply constant, represents *permanent* data that never changes.

A ~constant~ is also known as a =final= *variable* in Java.

In our ~ComputeArea~ program, ~p~ is a constant.

If you use it frequently, you don’t want to keep typing =3.14159;= instead, you can declare a *constant* for ~p~.

** Syntax
~final datatype CONSTANTNAME = value;~

A constant must be *declared* and *initialized* in the *same* *statement*.

The word =final= is a Java keyword for *declaring* a *constant*.

By convention, all letters in a constant are in *uppercase*.

For example, you can declare ~p~ as a *constant*:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ComputeArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double PI = 3.14159;
        // Create a Scanner Object
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Prompt the user to enter a radius
        System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: ");
        double radius = input.nextDouble();
        // Step 2: Compute Area
        double area = radius * radius * PI;
        // Step 3: Display the area
        System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " + radius + " is " + area);
    }
}
