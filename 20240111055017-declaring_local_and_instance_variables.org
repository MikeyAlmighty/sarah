* Declaring Local and Instance Variables

=local variables= are those defined with a ~method~ or ~block~, while =instance variables= are those that are defined as a ~member~ of a ~class~.

** Example

In the =Lion class=, ~snack~ and ~dinnertime~ are *local variables* only accessible within their respective /code blocks/, while ~hunger~ is an *instance variable* and created in every /object/ of the =Lion class=.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Lion {
    int hunger = 4;
    public int feedZooAnimals() {
        int snack = 10; // Local variable
        if (snack > 4) {
            long dinnerTime = snack++;
            hunger--;
        }
        return snack;
    }
}
#+END_SRC

All =local variable references= are *destroyed after the block is executed*, but the objects they point to may still be accessible.
