[[id:9bcf2aef-060a-4011-98b5-cb949a9f7d1a][Binary Operator]] that *modifies*, or *assigns*, the variable on the =LHS= of the operator with the result of the value on the =RHS=.

~variable = expression;~

An *expression* represents a computation involving =values=, =variables=, and =operators= that, taking them together, evaluates to a *value*.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int y = 1; // Assign 1 to variable Y
double radius = 1.0; // Assign 1.0 to variable radius
int x = 5 * (3 / 2); // Assign the value of the expression to X
x = y + 1; // Assign the addition of y and 1 to x
double area = radius * radius * 3.14159; // Compute area
#+END_SRC

Unlike most other Java operators, the assignment operator is *evaluated* from ~right to left~.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int herd = 1;
#+END_SRC

You can use a variable in an expression. A variable can also be used in both sides of the === *operator*.
For example: ~x = x + 1;~

In this *assignment* statement, the result of ~x + 1~ is *assigned* to =x=.

If =x= is =1= before the statement is *executed*, then it becomes =2= after the statement is *executed*.

To *assign* a =value= to a =variable=, you must place the =variable= name to the left of the assignment operator.
Thus, the following statement is wrong: ~1 = x; // Wrong~

An *assignment* *statement* is essentially an *expression* that evaluates to the value to be assigned to the variable on the =LHS= of the *assignment* *operator*.
For this reason, an *assignment* *statement* is also known as an *assignment* *expression*.

For example, the following statement is correct:
~System.out.println(x = 1);~

Which is equivalent to:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
x = 1;
System.out.println(x);
#+END_SRC

If a =value= is *assigned* to multiple =variables=, you can use chained assignments like this:
~i = j = k = 1;~
which is equivalent to:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
k = 1;
j = k;
i = j;
#+END_SRC

** Note
In an *assignment* *statement*, the *data* *type* of the =variable= on the *left* must be compatible with the data type of the *value* on the right.
For example, ~int x = 1.0~ would be illegal, because the data type of =x= is ~int~.

You cannot assign a ~double~ value (=1.0=) to an ~int~ variable without using [[id:3ef23225-ae37-428e-8ad3-5d7728f59478][Type Casting]].
