Objective: Prepare for MSc Computer Science by reviewing discrete math foundations using trusted resources.

** Week 1: Logic & Sets
- Resources:
  - Susanna Epp: Ch. 1–3
  - [[https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/logic][Khan Academy – Intro to Logic]]
- Topics:
  - Propositions, truth tables, logical operators
  - Logical equivalence and implication
  - Sets: union, intersection, difference
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Watch Khan Academy videos on logic
  - [ ] Complete Epp exercises Ch. 1–3
  - [ ] Write 5 truth tables
  - [ ] Practice with Venn diagrams

** Week 2: Implication, Quantifiers, Proofs
- Resources:
  - Susanna Epp: Ch. 4–6
  - [[https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/logic/a/logic-conditionals][Khan – Implications]]
- Topics:
  - Conditional logic and equivalence
  - Quantifiers (∀, ∃)
  - Direct proofs and proof strategies
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Review examples of quantified statements
  - [ ] Write 3 direct proofs from Epp Ch. 6
  - [ ] Do Khan quizzes on logic and conditionals

** Week 3: Functions, Induction
- Resources:
  - Susanna Epp: Ch. 7–8
- Topics:
  - Functions: domain, codomain, 1-1, onto, inverse
  - Mathematical induction (base case, inductive step)
  - Contrapositive and contradiction proofs
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Define 3 custom functions and analyze them
  - [ ] Solve 3 induction proofs
  - [ ] Read Epp Ch. 8 deeply

** Week 4: Combinatorics, Graphs, Probability
- Resources:
  - Susanna Epp: Ch. 9–11
  - [[https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library][Khan – Probability & Combinatorics]]
- Topics:
  - Counting: permutations & combinations
  - Basic graph theory: nodes, edges, degrees
  - Basic probability
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Do 10 combinatorics problems
  - [ ] Sketch 3 simple graphs (Epp Ch. 11)
  - [ ] Solve 5 probability examples from Khan

** Notes
- Optional video supplement: MIT OCW – Discrete Math (YouTube)
- Recommended pacing: 60–90 minutes/day
- Use spaced repetition for symbols and definitions
