** 1. Memory

Storage area for [[id:899ca310-9704-46b5-9177-b2d76a875456][programs]] and data during processing.

** 2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Where ~calculation~ and ~logical operations~ take place.
For a computer to act as a data processor, it must be able to do arithmetic operations on data (such as adding a list of numbers).
It should also be able to do logical operations on data.

** 3. Control Unit

Controls the operations of the ~memory~, ~ALU~ and the ~input/output~ subsystem.

** 4. Input / Output

The input subsystem accepts input data and the program from outside the computer, while the output subsystem sends the result of processing to the outside world.

The definition of the ~input/output~ subsystem is very broad: it also includes secondary storage devices such as *disk* or *tape* that stores ~data~ and ~programs~ for *processing*.

=Output Device= - When a disk *stores* data that results from processing.
=Input Device= - When a disk *reads* data.
