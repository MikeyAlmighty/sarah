#+title: Conversion Between Strings and Numbers

* Conversion Between Strings and Numbers
You can convert a =numeric= =string= into a =number=.

To convert a =string= into an =int= value, use the ~Integer.parseInt~.

~int intValue = Integer.parseInt(intString);~

where =intString= is a *numeric* *string* such as ~"123"~.

To convert a =string= into a =double= value, use the ~Double.parseDouble~.
~double doubleValue = Double.parseDouble(doubleString);~

where =doubleString= is a *numeric* *string* such as ~"123.45"~.

If the =string= is *not* a =numeric= string, the conversion would cause a *runtime* *error*.

The =Integer= and =Double= classes are both included in the ~java.lang~ package (automatically imported).

You can convert a =number= into a =string=; simply use the string concatenating operator as follows:
~String s = number + "";~
