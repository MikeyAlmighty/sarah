* The Universal Turing Machine

A Machine that can do any computation if the appropriate [[id:899ca310-9704-46b5-9177-b2d76a875456][program]] is provided, was the first description of a *modern computer*.

It can be proved that a very ~powerful computer~ and a ~universal Turing machine~ can *compute the same thing*.
We need only provide the ~data~ and the [[id:899ca310-9704-46b5-9177-b2d76a875456][program]] — the description of how to do the computation to either machine.

In fact, a ~universal Turing machine~ is capable of *computing anything that is computable*.
