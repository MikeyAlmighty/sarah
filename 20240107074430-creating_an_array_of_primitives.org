* Creating an Array of Primitives

#+BEGIN_SRC java
// int - Type of Array
// 3 - size of array
int[] numbers = new int[3];
#+END_SRC

When you use this form to instantiate an array, all elements are set to the *default value* for that ~type~.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int[] moreNumbers = new int[] {42, 55, 99};
#+END_SRC

Java recognizes that this expression is redundant.
(Since you are specifying the type of the array on the =LHS=, Java already knows the ~type~.
And since you are specifying the initial values, it already knows the ~size~.

** Anonymous Array

As a shortcut, Java lets you write this:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int[] moreNumbers = {42, 55, 99};
#+END_SRC

This approach is called an =anonymous array=, it is anonymous because you don’t specify the ~type~ and ~size~.

All valid:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
int[] numAnimals;
int [] numAnimals2;
int []numAnimals3;
int numAnimals4[];
int numAnimals5 [];
#+END_SRC

** Multiple Array Declaration

*Two* ~int~ =Arrays=
#+BEGIN_SRC java
int[] ids, types;
#+END_SRC

*** _Exam Trick_

*One* ~int~ array and one type ~int~
#+BEGIN_SRC java
int ids[], types;
#+END_SRC

Java sees this line of code and thinks something like this:

“They want two variables of type int. The first one is called ~ids[]~. This one is an ~int[]~ called ~ids~.
The second one is just called ~types~. No brackets, so it is a *regular integer*.”
