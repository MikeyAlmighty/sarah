#+title: CPU Cache

There are three different cache levels in a CPU:

* L3:
Largest and slowest of CPU cache.

However, it is often twice as fast as [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]].

L3 is the first CPU cache location to store data after it is transferred from [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]].

L3 cache is often =shared by all cores= in a single CPU.

* L2:
L2 cache holds *less data than L3* cache, but it has =faster access speeds=.

L2 holds a copy of the most recently accessed data that is not currently in use by the CPU.

Each *Core* normally has its *own* L2 cache.

* L1:
Fastest and smallest of the three CPU cache levels.

L1 holds the data currently in use by the CPU.

Each *Core* usually has its *own* L1 cache.
