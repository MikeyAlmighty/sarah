#+title: Floating point Literals

Floating-point data types come in two flavors: ~float~ and ~double~.

The default data type of a floating-point literal is *double*, but it can be explicitly designated by
appending the suffix ~D~ (or ~d~) to the value.

A floating-point literal can also be specified to be a *float* by appending the suffix ~F~ (or ~f~).

Floating-point literals can also be specified in scientific notation, where ~E~ (or ~e~) stands for *exponent*.
