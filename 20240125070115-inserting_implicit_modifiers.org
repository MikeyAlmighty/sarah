* Inserting Implicit modifiers

An ~implicit modifier~ is a *modifier* that the compiler *automatically* inserts into the code.

For example, an ~interface~ is *always considered to* be ~abstract~, even if it is not marked so.

The following list includes the *implicit modifiers* for ~interfaces~ that you need to know for the exam:

- ~Interfaces~ are implicitly ~abstract~.
- ~Interface variables~ are implicitly ~public~, ~static~, and ~final~.
- ~Interface methods~ without a body are implicitly ~abstract~.
- ~Interface methods~ without the ~private~ modifier are implicitly ~public~.

** Example

The following two ~interface~ definitions are *equivalent*, as the compiler will convert them both to the second declaration:


#+BEGIN_SRC java
public interface Soar {
    int MAX_HEIGHT = 10;
    final static boolean UNDERWATER = true;
    void fly(int speed);
    abstract void takeoff();
    public abstract double dive();
}

public abstract interface Soar {
    public static final int MAX_HEIGHT = 10;
    public final static boolean UNDERWATER = true;
    public abstract void fly(int speed);
    public abstract void takeoff();
    public abstract double dive();
}
#+END_SRC

** Conflicting Modifiers

What happens if a developer marks a method or variable with a *modifier* that conflicts with an implicit modifier?
For example, if an ~abstract method~ is implicitly ~public~, can it be explicitly marked ~protected~ or ~private~?

*** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public interface Dance {
    private int count = 4; // DOES NOT COMPILE
    protected void step(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
#+END_SRC

Neither of these interface member declarations compiles, as the compiler will apply the public modifier to both, resulting in a *conflict*.
