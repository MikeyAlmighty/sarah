#+title: Parsers

* Parser

Software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse *tree*, [[id:591ff1e4-b71e-4fd8-b700-ead280215a63][Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)]] or other hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input, checking for correct syntax in the process.

The *parser* is often preceded by a separate [[id:33633f04-050f-43a2-8d91-f538ca8b27c7][Lexical analyser]], which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters.

** Syntactic Analysis
While building up the data structure, parsers unavoidably *analyse* the input, checking that it *conforms* to the *expected structure*.

* Two main strategies for parsing
1. [[id:36076481-3430-4352-9486-9ba937df495e][Top-down Parsing]]
2. [[id:f44128c6-a450-4cd1-88b7-04a312b7b253][Bottom-up Parsing]]

Instead, let me just say, that the difference between top down and bottom up parsers is that the former starts with constructing root node
of the AST and then descends while the latter does it the other way around.
