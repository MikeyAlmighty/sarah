* Storage Devices


A computer’s [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]] is a *volatile* form of data storage: Any information that has been saved in memory is *lost* when the system’s power is turned off.

Programs and data are permanently stored on ~storage devices~ and are moved, when the computer actually uses them, to *memory*, which operates at much faster speeds than permanent storage devices can.
