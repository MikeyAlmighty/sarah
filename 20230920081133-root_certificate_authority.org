#+title: Root Certificate Authority

*Self-signed* (start of the chain of trust), so there's no higher authority that can sign on their behalf.

Can use the self-signed certificate and the associated =private-key= to begin signing other =public-keys- and issuing [[id:dc321a18-5fdd-49c8-8969-0a4752dcb1dd][certificates]].
