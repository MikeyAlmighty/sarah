#+title: Strategy Pattern

* Strategy Pattern

[[https://github.com/MikeyAlmighty/design-patterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/src/main/java/org/designpatterns/structural/strategy][Strategy Design Pattern Impl]]

The *Strategy Pattern* defines a *family of algorithms*, *encapsulates* each one, and makes them *interchangeable*.

*Strategy* lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Favours Composition over inheritance.
- Allows you to change behaviour (Dynamically) at runtime.

** When to use
- When you need to use one of several behaviours dynamically.
- Avoid Duplicate Code.
- Often reduces long lists of conditionals.
- Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes.
- Can hide complicated/secret code from user.

** Negative
- Increased number of Objects/Classes
