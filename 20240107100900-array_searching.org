* Array Searching

Java also provides a convenient way to *search*, but only if the array is already [[id:1a328fa4-9b9f-4856-88f3-fd490bce565b][sorted]].

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int[] numbers = { 2, 4, 6, 8 };

System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 2)); // 0
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 4)); // 1
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 1)); // -1
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 3)); // -2
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 9)); // -5

Although ~1~ isn’t in the list, the search can determine that it should be inserted at element ~0~ to *preserve the sorted order*.
Since ~0~ already means something for array indexes, Java needs to *subtract 1* to give us the answer of ~–1~.

Although ~3~ isn’t in the list, it would need to be inserted at element ~1~ to preserve the sorted order.

We *negate* and *subtract 1* for consistency, getting ~–1 –1~, also known as ~–2~.

Finally, ~9~ should be inserted at index ~4~. We again negate and subtract 1, getting ~–4 –1~, also known as ~–5~.
