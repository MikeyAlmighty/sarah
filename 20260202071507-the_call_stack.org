#+title: The Call Stack

* The Call Stack

Each time a method is *invoked*, the system creates an =activation record= that stores *parameters* and *variables* for the ~method~ and places the =activation record= in an area of memory known as a call stack.

A *call* *stack* is also known as an *execution* *stack*, *runtime* *stack*, or *machine* *stack* and it is often shortened to just “ *the* *stack*.”

When a method calls another method, the caller’s =activation record= is kept intact and a new =activation= =record= is created for the new method called.

When a method finishes its work and returns to its caller, its =activation= =record= is *removed* from the *call* *stack*.

A call stack stores the activation records in a ~last-in, first-out~ fashion:

The =activation record= for the method that is *invoked* *last* is *removed* *first*.
