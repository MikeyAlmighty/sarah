#+title: Power Supply Unit (PSU)

Converts electricity from your wall to something usable.

* Types of electricity:
** DC
Flows in one direction
** AC
Changes directions constantly.

Our computers use =DC= voltage so we have to have a way to convert the =AC= voltage from our power company to something we can use.

That's what our power supply does.

It converts the =AC= we get from the wall into *low voltage* =DC= power that we can use and transmit throughout our computer.
