#+title: Greatest Common Factor (GCF / GCD)

The Greatest Common Factor (GCF) — also known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) — is the largest number that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

* How to find the GCF:

Example: Find the GCF of *36* and *60*
** Step 1: [[id:65e1de7b-1a48-4e85-86eb-fc2a85e0734b][Prime Factorization]]

36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2² × 3²
60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3 × 5

** Step 2: Identify Common Prime Factors
Common factors: 2² and 3

** Step 3: Multiply Common Prime Factors
GCF = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12

GCF(36, 60) = 12
