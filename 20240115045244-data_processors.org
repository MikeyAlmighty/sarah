* Data Processors

Before discussing the [[id:215906d9-9200-42b8-afbf-3c30b0f6c585][Turing Model]], let us define a computer as a *data processor*.

** Single purpose Computing Machine

Using this definition, a computer acts as a black box:
- ~Accepts input data~
- ~Processes the data~
- ~Creates output data~

** Limitations

- Although this model can define the functionality of a computer today, it is *too* general.
- Another problem with this model is that it does not specify the *type of* ~processing~, or whether *more than one* type of ~processing~ is possible. I.e. not clear on how many sets of operations a machine based on this model can perform.

This model could represent a ~specific-purpose computer~ (or *processor*) that is designed to do a *single* job(such as controlling the temperature)

However, computers, as the term is used today, are ~general-purpose~ machines. They can do *many* different types of tasks.

This implies that we need to change this model into the [[id:215906d9-9200-42b8-afbf-3c30b0f6c585][Turing Model]] to be able to reflect the actual computers of today.
