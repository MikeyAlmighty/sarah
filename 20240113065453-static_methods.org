* Static Methods

In addition to ~main()~ methods, =static= methods have two main purposes:

1. For *utility* or *helper methods* that *don’t* require any ~object state~. Since there is *no* need to access ~instance~ variables, having =static= methods eliminates the need for the caller to /instantiate/ an ~object~ just to call the method.

2. For *state* that is *shared* by all /instances/ of a ~class~, like a counter. All instances must share the same state. Methods that merely use that state should be static as well.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Koala {
    public static int count = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) { // static method
        System.out.print(count); // static variable
    }
}
#+END_SRC
