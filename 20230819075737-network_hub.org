#+title: Network Hub

A hub is a [[id:4a16abe5-9d6e-41e7-ac14-457479594c80][1. Physical Layer]] device that allows for connections from many computers at once.

A node that *broadcasts* data to *every* computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it.

All the devices connected to a hub will end up talking to all other devices at the *same* time.

It's up to each system connected to the hub to determine if the incoming data was meant for them or to ignore it if it isn't.

This causes a lot of noise on the network and creates what's called a [[id:85e75571-71a6-4f6a-a1ef-7dff5e8f784d][collision domain]].
