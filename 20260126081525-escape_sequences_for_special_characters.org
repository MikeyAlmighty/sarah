#+title: Escape Sequences for Special Characters

* Escape Sequences for Special Characters
This special notation, called an *escape* *sequence*, consists of a ~backslash (\)~ followed by a =character= or a *combination* of =digits=.

For example, ~\t~ is an *escape* *sequence* for the *Tab* =character=, and an escape sequence such as ~\u03b1~ is used to represent a [[id:25824dca-cd38-447d-84fd-8c69f246709f][Unicode]].

The symbols in an escape sequence are interpreted as a whole rather than individually.

An escape sequence is considered as a *single* =character=.

| Escape Sequence | Name            | Unicode Code | Decimal Value |
|-----------------+-----------------+--------------+---------------|
| \b              | Backspace       | \u0008       |             8 |
| \t              | Tab             | \u0009       |             9 |
| \n              | Linefeed        | \u000A       |            10 |
| \f              | Formfeed        | \u000C       |            12 |
| \r              | Carriage Return | \u000D       |            13 |
| \\              | Backslash       | \u005C       |            92 |
| \"              | Double Quote    | \u0022       |            34 |

** Examples

~System.out.println("He said \"Java is fun\"");~
The output is =He said "Java is fun"=

Note the symbols ~\~ and ~"~ together represent *one* =character=.

The backslash ~\~ is called an [[id:48e303b0-6764-4008-9c56-694ea8e0f0cd][Escape Character]].
