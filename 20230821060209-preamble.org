#+title: Preamble

*8 Bytes (64 Bits)* can be split into two sections:

* First 7 Bytes
The first *seven* bytes are a series of alternating ones and zeros.

These act partially as a buffer between frames and can also be used by the network interfaces to synchronize internal clocks they use to regulate the speed at which they send data.

* Last Byte
The last byte is known as the [[id:c930c2f7-2cc9-4143-b5e9-99cb5e3309a2][SFD]].
