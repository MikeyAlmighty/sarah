#+title: Lesson 4 Plan the work (Goal - finish)
#+filetags: :SAFe


* 4.1 Creating the backlog
Work originates locally and from broader contexts
Agile team backlog is comprised of Stories

** Contains all the work for the team
** Created by the PO and the team
** Prioritized by the PO
** Contains User and Enabler Stories
*** User Stories provide Customers with value
*** Enabler stories build the infrastructure and architecture that makes User Stories Possibles

** Stories for near-term Iterations are more detailted than Stories for later Iterations
** NFRs are backlog contstraints

Backlog prioritization without connection to the user journey
*** Backlogs are optimized to help teams focus on priorities
**** Backlogs have some challenges
- Can be difficult to understand workflows
- Relationship between 'Stories that make something good' and 'Stories that make something better or great' is lost

*** Story maps overcome these challenges
- Overcome backlog challenges
- Story maps feed the backlog: quality, value

*** Acceptance Criteria
- Provide the details of the story from a testing pov
- Are created by the agile team
- Can be written in the Given-When-Then format

** Backlog Refinement
** Fibonacci is used for estimation

** Plan -> Do -> Check -> Adjust (At both an iteration and ART level)

* 4.2 PI Planning

*** Benefits
- Personal communication across all team members and stakeholders
- Aligns development of business goals with business context
- Identifies dependencies
- Allows for faster decision making

*** Create alignment with PI Objectives

- Objectives are business summaries of what each team intends to deliver in the upcoming PI
- Often directly relate to intended features in the backlog

  Before Value (BV)
  After Value (AV)

*** Uncomitted objectives
help improve the predictability of delivering business value.
- They are planned, not extra things teams do "just in case you have time"
- They are not included in the commitment
- If a team has low confidence in meeting a PI objective, it should be moved to uncommitted
- If an objective has many unknowns, consider moving to uncommitted and putting in early spikes.
- Uncommitted objectives count when calculating load

Outcomes of PI planning
- Communication
- Estimate Capacity
- Objectives
- Manage Risks
