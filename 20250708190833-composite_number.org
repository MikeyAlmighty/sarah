#+title: Composite Number

Composite numbers are **natural numbers greater than 1** that are **not [[id:78813b3d-9825-475b-a4bb-95a00e181ac0][Prime]]**, meaning they have **more than two positive divisors**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Can be **factored** into smaller natural numbers.
- Every composite number is divisible by at least one **prime number** (other than itself).
- The **smallest composite number** is 4.

**Examples:**
- Composites: 4 (2×2), 6 (2×3), 8 (2×4), 9 (3×3), 10 (2×5)
- Not Composites: 2, 3, 5, 7 (these are primes), 1 (not prime or composite)

**Mathematical Definition:**
A number \( n > 1 \) is **composite** ⇔ \( \exists\ a, b \in \mathbb{N},\ 1 < a < n,\ 1 < b < n,\ ab = n \)

**Properties:**
- Every composite number can be written as a **[[id:7edc1d79-a1d5-4211-8c72-70b4468eab3d][product of prime numbers]]**.
- There are infinitely many composite numbers (just as there are infinitely many primes).
