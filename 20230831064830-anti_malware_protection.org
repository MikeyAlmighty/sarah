* Gather and verify

If you suspect that the computer is infected, you should gather information from the user.
It is helpful to note when the symptoms started and if the user has downloaded any unusual files.

If the computer has one or more of the following symptoms it may be infected with malware:

- Running slower than normal
- Restarts on its own multiple times
- Uses all or a higher than normal amount of memory

* Quarantine malware

Some malware communicates with bad actors or sends out sensitive information.

Other malware is designed to take part in a distributed [[id:ca248324-6746-4bdd-994c-42f69cb33f8d][botnet]].

To quarantine, or separate, the infected device from the rest of the network, you should disconnect from the internet by turning off WiFi and unplugging the ethernet cable.

Once the computer is disconnected, the malware can no longer spread to other computers on the network.

You should also disable any automatic system backup.

Some malware can reinfect a computer by using automatic backup, because you can restore the system with files infected by the malware.
