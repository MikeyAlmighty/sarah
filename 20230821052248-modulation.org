#+title: Modulation

Modulation is a way of varying the [[id:ae273795-fd04-4e73-818a-29687c30aae9][voltage]] of the charge moving across the cable.

When used for computer networks, this kind of modulation is more specifically known as [[id:b2d2f227-3d20-48a5-b648-61c99df16e8c][line Coding]].

It allows devices on either end of a link to understand that an electrical charge in a certain state is a zero and another state is a one.
