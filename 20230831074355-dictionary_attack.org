#+title: Dictionary Attack

A dictionary attack doesn't test out [[id:48f530b9-0b3d-40a3-98ec-75e52f7de13b][brute force]] combinations like =abc1= or =ABC1=.

Instead, it tries out words that are *commonly* used and passwords

The best way to prevent a password attack is to utilize strong passwords.
