* Access Modifiers

Determines what classes a method can be accessed from

** Private

The ~private~ modifier means the method can be called only from within the same class.

** Package Access

With ~package access~, the method can be called only from a class in the same package.
This one is tricky because there is no keyword. You simply *omit* the =access modifier=.

Package access is sometimes referred to as =package-private= or =default access=.

** Protected

The ~protected~ modifier means the method can be called only from a class in the *same* =package= or a =subclass=.

** public

The ~public~ modifier means the method can be called from =anywhere=.

*** _Exam Trick_

While [[id:0d43fdee-5463-4f66-8b65-ae9a7b4b74e2][Access Modifiers]] and [[id:78bf41e5-259a-4c97-8df7-1685989e3d8c][Optional Specifiers]] can appear in any order, they must all appear *before* the [[id:5e81a1a6-e8f3-40c5-923c-58124deef377][Return Type]].

Remember, [[id:0d43fdee-5463-4f66-8b65-ae9a7b4b74e2][Access Modifiers]] and [[id:78bf41e5-259a-4c97-8df7-1685989e3d8c][Optional Specifiers]] can be listed in *any order*, but once the [[id:5e81a1a6-e8f3-40c5-923c-58124deef377][Return Type]] is specified, the rest of the parts of the method are written in a specific order: ~name~, ~parameter list~, ~exception list~, ~body~.
