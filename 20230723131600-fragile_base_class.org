#+title: Fragile Base Class

The fragile base class problem is a fundamental architectural problem of [[id:5f13e7ad-c431-4eba-b5b6-74a4b444efcc][OOP]] systems where  =base= classes (=superclasses=) are considered "fragile" because seemingly safe modifications to a base class, when inherited by the derived classes, may cause the derived classes to malfunction.

The programmer cannot determine whether a base class change is safe simply by examining in isolation the methods of the base class.

One possible solution is to make instance variables private to their defining class and force subclasses to use accessors to modify superclass states.
