#+title: Mongo DB

* Description
Cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

* atomic operation
An `atomic operation` is a *write* operation which either *completes entirely*, or *does not complete at all*.
In the case of [[id:11f1bb9a-461f-44a6-a6ff-b112a0d32e34][Distributed Transactions]], which involve writes to multiple documents, all writes to each document must succeed for the transaction to succeed.
Atomic operations *cannot* partially complete.
