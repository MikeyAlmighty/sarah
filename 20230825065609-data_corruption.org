#+title: Data Corruption

A data buffer is a region of RAM that's used to temporarily store data while it's being moved around.

So when you copy something from your =OS= to your =USB= drive, it first gets copied to a data buffer because =RAM= operates faster than hard drives.

So if you don't properly unmount a file system and give your buffer enough time to finish moving data, you run the risk of data corruption.
