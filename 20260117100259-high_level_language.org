#+title: High-level Language

* High-level Language
They are platform independent, which means that you can write a program in a ~high-level~ language and *run* it in *different* *types* of *machines*.

The instructions in a ~high-level programming language~ are called =statements=.

There are many ~high-level programming languages~, and each was designed for a specific purpose.

A program written in a ~high-level language~ is called a =source program= or =source code=.

Because a computer cannot execute a =source program=, a source program must be *translated* into [[id:89afff2d-63e0-4cc8-87fb-b30d65018241][machine code]] for execution.

The *translation* can be done using another programming tool called an [[id:a1a50ead-317b-46c3-a27a-b41e8fbf60ea][Interpreter]] or a [[id:44534722-acbc-4a80-8c65-3f76edefd7b5][Compiler]].
