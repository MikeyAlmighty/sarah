#+title: RC4 No More Attack

This attack was able to recover an *authentication cookie* from a [[id:6a21b3d4-bccc-420f-8f1b-06ac6f21d628][TLS]] encrypted connection in just *52 hours*.

As this is an attack on the [[id:54c8e6e5-5c4e-4d9a-bc50-151177f171ce][RC4]] cipher itself, any protocol that uses this cipher is potentially vulnerable to the attack.

[[id:54c8e6e5-5c4e-4d9a-bc50-151177f171ce][RC4]] was used in a bunch of popular encryption protocols, like [[id:b3c03e1d-537e-445f-a867-0349754008f7][WEP]] and [[id:aef3e0c2-3afc-49bf-ae95-e39a6923fdfa][WPA]]

It was also supported in [[id:dcdb62e9-3bf9-47e4-985b-b980b23f7db2][SSL]] and [[id:6a21b3d4-bccc-420f-8f1b-06ac6f21d628][TLS]] until *2015* when [[id:54c8e6e5-5c4e-4d9a-bc50-151177f171ce][RC4]] was dropped in all versions of [[id:6a21b3d4-bccc-420f-8f1b-06ac6f21d628][TLS]] because of inherent weaknesses.

Most major web browsers have dropped support for [[id:54c8e6e5-5c4e-4d9a-bc50-151177f171ce][RC4]] entirely along with all versions of [[id:dcdb62e9-3bf9-47e4-985b-b980b23f7db2][SSL]] (use [[id:6a21b3d4-bccc-420f-8f1b-06ac6f21d628][TLS]] instead).
