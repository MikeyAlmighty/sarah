#+title: XNOR Gate

It involves *two* input signals.

The XNOR rule outputs an =ON= signal only when both the inputs are the same (both =ON= or both =OFF=). Otherwise, the output signal will be =OFF=.

| INPUT A | INPUT B | OUTPUT |
|---------+---------+--------|
| ON      | OFF     | OFF  |
| ON      | ON      | ON  |
| OFF     | ON      | OFF  |
| OFF     | OFF     | ON   |
