#+title: Known-Plaintext Analysis (KPA)

Requires access to some or all of the =plaintext= of the encrypted information.

The =plaintext= is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written in code.

The analyst's goal is to examine the known =plaintext= to determine the *key* used to *encrypt* the message.

Then they use the *key* to *decrypt* the encoded information.
