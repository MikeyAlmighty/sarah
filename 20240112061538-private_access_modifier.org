* Private Access Modifier

The ~private~ modifier means the method can be called only from *within the same class*.

Only code in the *same class* can =call= ~private methods~ or =access= ~private fields~.

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC java
package pond.duck;

public class FatherDuck {
    private String noise = "quack";
    private void quack() {
        System.out.print(noise); // private access is ok
    }
}

package pond.duck;

public class BadDuckling {
    public void makeNoise() {
        var duck = new FatherDuck();
        duck.quack(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
        System.out.print(duck.noise); // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
}
#+END_SRC

** _Exam Trick_

In the previous example, ~FatherDuck~ and ~BadDuckling~ are in *separate files*, but what if they were declared in the same file?
Even then, the code would *still not compile* as Java prevents access *outside* the =class=.
