#+title: Floating Point Types

* Floating Point Types
Java uses *two* types for =floating-point= numbers: ~float~ and ~double~.
The ~double~ type is *twice* as big as ~float~,

- ~double~ *double precision*
- ~float~ *single precision*

Normally, you should use the ~double~ type, because it is *more* *accurate* than the ~float~ type.

** float
Size: =32= =bits=
Range: Approximately =±3.40282347E+38F= (6-7 significant decimal digits)
Use case: Useful for saving memory when precision is *not* critical.

** double
Size: =64= =bits=
Range: Approximately =±1.79769313486231570E+308= (15 significant decimal digits)
Use case: Default for *decimal* values; provides greater precision for calculations.
