#+title: Accessing Static Data

* Accessing Static Data

When the =static= keyword is applied to a ~variable~, ~method~, or ~class~, it belongs to the =class= *rather than a specific instance* of the =class=.

These methods: 
- Can be called *without* creating an =object= of the =class=.  
- Can only access =static= =variables= and other =static= =methods= directly. 
- Are useful for utility functions (e.g., ~Math.pow()~, ~Arrays.sort()~).
