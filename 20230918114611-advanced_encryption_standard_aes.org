#+title: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

*2001*

Also the first and only public [[id:ff735327-4e77-43b6-8755-50ceccc7f9a0][cipher]] that's approved for use with top secret information by the *NSA*

[[id:735e47da-fa00-497b-b707-ba607c1ba7ed][Symmetric]] [[id:2acddcbe-0490-4b4b-9c80-707dc3592d9c][Block cipher]]
similar to and replaced [[id:9de54ecb-3412-4227-99e1-3ac76b992ace][DES]]

=AES= uses *128-bit* blocks (twice the size of [[id:9de54ecb-3412-4227-99e1-3ac76b992ace][DES]])

Key length: *128=bit*, *192=bit*, *256=bit*

Modern [[id:434b40ba-6fee-45ee-95e0-f8b79f751cdd][CPUs]] from Intel or AMD have =AES= instructions built into the CPUs themselves.
This allows for far greater computational speed and efficiency when working on cryptographic workloads.
