#+title: Email Spoofing

A [[id:99c92f26-62e7-4d66-a978-87781d57e914][Social Engineering]] attack

Spoofing is when a source is *masquerading* around as something else.

Think of an email spoof.

This is what happens when you receive an email with a misleading sender address.

You can send an email and have it appear to come from anywhere you want, whether it exists or not.
