#+title: GUID Partition Table (GPT)

- Supports greater than *2TB*
- Only has one type of [[id:0a2f5c6a-f45a-4468-93b5-c0e24fd48c06][partition]].

You can make as many of them as you want in a disk.

In an earlier lesson, we learned about a new bios standard called UEFI.

That's become the default bios for new systems.

To use [[id:0e0f66f9-1c8b-4604-b6a9-2d54d8509511][UEFI]] booting, your disk has to use the [[id:ef24c667-11eb-46c4-9b11-3907601568c8][GUID Partition Table (GPT)]].
