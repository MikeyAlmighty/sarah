- Every node has at **MOST** 2 children (0, 1 or 2 children per node)
- Exactly 1 root
- Exactly 1 path **between** root and any node.

Empty tree (0 Nodes), is also a Binary Tree.

Node exploring can be achieved by either [BFS](../../Algorithms/Breadth%20First%20Search.md) or [DFS](../../Algorithms//Depth%20First%20Search.md)
