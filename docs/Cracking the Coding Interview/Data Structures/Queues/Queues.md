# Queues

Similar to [Stacks](./../Stacks/Stacks.md) except that a Queue uses a FIFO (First-in First-out) ordering.

## Operations
Following operations are available on a queue:
- enqueue(item) Add an item to end of list
- dequeue() remove the first (front) item in the list 
- peek() Return the top of the queue
- isEmpty() Return boolean on if stack is empty (or not).
