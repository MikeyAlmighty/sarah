Re: Application for the position of XXXXXXXXXXX

Dear XXXXXXXXXXX,

I would like to apply for the position of Senior Front-End developer as advertised on XXXXXXXXXXX.
I have extensive experience in the web development realm specializing in React and Next.js using JavaScript/TypeScript that will perfectly fit the advertised job requirements.

I received my Higher Certificate in Information Systems (Software Development) from CTI Education Group in 2015 and have 6 years industry experience in Front-end and mobile development.
 In my Senior Front-end developer position at Full Facing I am responsible for the development of new features, maintenance of existing functionality, setup of github action CI/CD pipelines and peer reviewing pull requests from junior developers.

I feel that my experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and passion for building ground-breaking products would be of great benefit to XXXXXXXXXXX.

Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions you would like to discuss.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Michael Leibbrandt
