# Recursion

1. What is the least amount of work I can do.
2. When would the process complete (Stopping condition or Base Case)

| Pros          | Cons          |
| ------------- |---------------|
| Bridges gap between elegance and complexity | Slowness due to CPU overhead|
| Reduces need for complex loops and auxiliary data structures | Can lead to out of memory errors/ stack overflow exceptions |
| Can reduce time complexity easily with **memoization** | Can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed |
| Works really well with recursive structures like trees/graphs | |
