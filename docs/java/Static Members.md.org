When we want to present a concept that should exist in a single place.
Value is independent of objects but we want to share it across all
objects.

FACT: =main= method is =static= so that the JRE can directly call this
method without having to create an object.

Below example =numberOfEmployees= does not pertain to each instance
(object) but rather all instances.

#+begin_src java
// ...Main
var employee = new Employee(50_000, 20);
var employee1 = new Employee(50_000, 20);
var employee2 = new Employee(50_000, 20);
var employee3 = new Employee(50_000, 20);
System.out.println(Employee.numberOfEmployees); // 4
// ...

public class Employee {
    private int baseSalary;
    private int hourlyRate;

    public static int numberOfEmployees;

    public Employee(int baseSalary) {
        setBaseSalary(baseSalary);
        setHourlyRate(0);
        numberOfEmployees++;
    }
}
