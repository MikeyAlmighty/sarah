* Interface vs Abstraction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interface-vs-abstraction
:END:
Interfaces have changed (Now you can have private and static methods in
an interface).

- Interfaces (Contracts) To build loosely-coupled, extensible, testable
  applications.
- Abstract Classes (Partially-completed Classes) To share code.

*NOTE*: Some people abuse Interfaces now in order to achieve multiple
inheritance
