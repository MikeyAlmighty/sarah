# Interface vs Abstraction

Interfaces have changed (Now you can have private and static methods in an interface).

- Interfaces (Contracts) To build loosely-coupled, extensible, testable applications.
- Abstract Classes (Partially-completed Classes) To share code.

**NOTE**: Some people abuse Interfaces now in order to achieve multiple inheritance
