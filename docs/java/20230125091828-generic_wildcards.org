#+title: Generic Wildcards

=<?>= : unknown Type (Wildcard)

Note: =Accountant extends Employee=

* =extends=
Upper Bound
#+begin_src java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<Accountant> accountants = new ArrayList<>();
    employees = accountants; // Compilation Error (Type Mismatch)
}
#+end_src

Below we are saying that =ArrayList<? extends Employee>= Accepts any =Subclass= (read: lower) of Employee (or Employee itself).
(Below compiles successfully as Account is a subclass of Employee.)

#+begin_src java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<? extends Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<Accountant> accountants = new ArrayList<>();
    employees = accountants; // Okay!
}
#+end_src


* =Super=
Lower Bound
(Prevents subclasses)
#+begin_src java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<? super Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<Accountant> accountants = new ArrayList<>();
    employees = accountants; // Compilation Error (Type Mismatch)
}
#+end_src

Below we are saying that =ArrayList<? super Employee>= Accepts any Employee or Employee's Base(Parent) class. - Which in this case is =Object=.
(Below compiles successfully as Account is a subclass of Employee.)

#+begin_src java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<? super Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<Object> accountants = new ArrayList<>();
    employees = accountants; // Okay!
}
#+end_src
