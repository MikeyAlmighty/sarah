#+title: Lesson 7 Improve Relentlessly
#+filetags: :SAFe

Business agility requires improvement in three domains:
- Competency
- Flow
- Outcomes

* 7.1 Improving competency
Competency improvement activies include:
- Retros
- SAFe assessments
- Inspect and Adapt

** Competency Assessments
Team and technical Agility Self-Assessment

- Periodically measure the progress being made toward the three dimensions of each competency.
- Identify specific practices for potential improvement.
- reassess periodically to observe trends.
- Make growth recommendations available as you assess.

** Inspect and Adapt
1. PI System Demo
2. Quantitative and Qualitative Measurement
3. Problem-Solving workshop (How do we solve the problems identified)
   3.1 Agree on problem to solve
   3.2 Apply root-cause analysis and 5 whys
   3.3 Identify biggest root-cause using pareto analysis
   3.4 Restate new problem for biggest root-cause
   3.5 Brainstorm solutions
   4.6 Identify improvement backlog items

* 7.2 Improving flow

Delivering a continuous flow of value to customers in shortest sustainable timeframe

** 8 Flow Accelerators
1. Visualize and limit WIP
2. Address bottlenecks
3. Minimize handoffs and dependencies
4. Get faster feedback
5. Work in smaller batches
6. Reduce Queue lengths
7. Optimize time 'in the zone'
8. Remediate legacy policies and practices

** 6 Flow Metrics
1. Flow distribution (Ensures healthy balance of work item types)
2. Flow velocity (Tracks team performance each iteration)
3. Flow Time (Ensures teams deliver values in the shortest possible time)
4. Flow Load (Leading indicatior of excess WIP)
5. Flow Efficiency (Highlights waste, bottlenecks and delays in the system)
6. Flow Predictability (Predictability Measure compares actual business value to planned business value)


* 7.3 Improving outcomes
[[id:9e735306-d821-4dc6-a02e-cda190952e53][Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)]] create goals towards achieving business outcomes
