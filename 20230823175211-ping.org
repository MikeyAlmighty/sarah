#+title: Ping

=Ping= lets you send a special type of [[id:511bcb87-0570-45a0-8e69-96efcbe1c78e][ICMP]] message called an *echo request*.

1. An ICMP =Echo Request= essentially just as a destination. Hey, are you there?

2. If the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it'll send back an [[id:511bcb87-0570-45a0-8e69-96efcbe1c78e][ICMP]] =Echo Reply= message type.
