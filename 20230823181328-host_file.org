#+title: Hosts file

A flat file that contains on each line a =network address= followed by the host name it can be referred to as.

For example, a line in a host file might read =1.2.3.4 web server=.

This means that on the computer where this host file resides, a user could just refer to web server instead of the IP =1.2.3.4=.
