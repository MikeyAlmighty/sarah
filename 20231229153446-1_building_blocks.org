* Chapter 1. Building Blocks
** Exam Objectives
*** Handling date, time, text, numeric and boolean values
- Use primitives and ~wrapper~ classes including ~Math~ API, parentheses, *type promotion*, and *casting* to evaluate *arithmetic* and *boolean* expressions

*** Utilizing Java Object­Oriented Approach
- Declare and instantiate Java objects including ~nested class~ objects, and explain the object life­cycle including ~creation~, ~reassigning references~, and ~garbage collection~
- Understand *variable scopes*, use local variable type inference, apply [[id:89e69431-4199-42ee-8633-4c2cc5da4d8a][encapsulation]], and make objects *immutable*

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance Members  | The instance variables and instance methods of an object. members They can be accessed or invoked only through an object reference.                                                 |
| Instance Variable | A field that is allocated when the class is instantiated (i.e.,when an object of the class is created). Also called a non-static field or just a field when the context is obvious. |
| Instance method   | A method that belongs to an instance of the class. Objects of the same class share its implementation.                                                                              |
| Static Members    | The static variables and static methods of a class. They can be accessed or invoked either by using the class name or through an object reference.                                  |
| Static Variable   | A field that is allocated when the class is loaded. It belongs to the class, and not to any specific object of the class. Also called a static field or a class variable.           |
| Static Method     | A method that belongs to the class, and not to any object of the class. Also called a class method.                                                                                 |
|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                     |

** Compiling
Compiled using the [[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]]

Each ~class~ declaration in a source file is compiled into a separate ~class file~, containing its Java bytecode.
The name of this file comprises the name of the class with ~.class~ as its extension.

Although a Java source file can contain more than one class declaration, [[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]] enforces the rule that there can *only be at the most* one class
in the source file that has ~public access~.

If there is a ~public class~ in the source file, the name of the source file must be the name of the public class with ~.java~ as its extension.

In the absence of a public class in the source file, the name of the file can be arbitrary, but still with the ~.java~ extension.

** Running
It is the ~bytecode~ in the class files that is executed when a Java program is run—the source code is irrelevant in this regard.
A Java program is run by the Java Application Launcher, ~java~, which is also part of the JDK.
The ~java~ command creates an instance of the JVM that executes the bytecode.
