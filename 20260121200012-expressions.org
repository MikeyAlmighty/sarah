#+title: Expressions

* Expressions

Combination of *variables*, *constants*, and *operators* that evaluates to a ~single~ ~value~.

In Java, variables and expressions are closely linked because variables are often used within expressions to store and manipulate data.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
int x = 42;      // Variable 'x' holds the value 5
int y = 2187;     // Variable 'y' holds the value 10
int sum = x + y; // The expression 'x + y' uses the variables to calculate a value (5 + 10)
System.out.println(sum); // Outputs 2229
#+END_SRC

** Key links between Variables and Expressions
~Variables~ hold data values.
~Expressions~ use variables to perform calculations, comparisons, and other operations.

The result of an expression can be stored in a variable.

Variables are key elements within expressions, allowing you to manipulate and store data dynamically throughout your program.

In summary, variables *store* *data*, and expressions manipulate that data to produce new values.
