There are many social and economic reasons why some people have digital literacy skills and other people do not.
This growing skills gap is known as the =digital divide=.

Overcoming the digital divide, not only involves confronting and understanding the combination of socio-economic factors that shape our experience, but also helping others confront and understand those experiences.
