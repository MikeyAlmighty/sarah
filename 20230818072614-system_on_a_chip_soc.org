#+title: System On a Chip (SOC)

A system on a chip packs the [[id:434b40ba-6fee-45ee-95e0-f8b79f751cdd][CPU]], [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]] and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip.

Not only are SOC small, they use less battery power than if those components were separated.
