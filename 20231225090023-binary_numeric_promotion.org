#+title: Binary Numeric Promotion

*Binary Numeric Promotion* implicitly applies appropriate widening primitive conversions so that the widest numeric type of a pair of operands is always at least ~int~.
If ~T~ is the widest numeric type of two operands after any [[id:2af44b3c-ac25-4fc8-a372-20adc491f7f5][unboxing]] conversions have been performed, the
operands are promoted as follows during binary numeric promotion:

If ~T~ is wider than ~int~, both operands are converted to ~T~; otherwise, both operands are converted to ~int~.
This means that the resulting type of the operands is at least ~int~.

Binary numeric promotion is applied in the following expressions:
- Operands of the arithmetic operators ~*, /, %, +,~ and ~-~
- Operands of the relational operators ~<, <=, >,~ and ~>=~
- Operands of the numerical equality operators ~==~ and ~!=~
- Operands of the conditional operator ~? :~, under certain circumstances
