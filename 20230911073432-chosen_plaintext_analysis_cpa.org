#+title: Chosen-Plaintext Analysis (CPA)

Requires that the attacker knows the [[id:d5db0593-2283-4d73-b904-bcd9f32717ce][Encryption Algorithm]] or has access to the device used to do the [[id:3389ae98-fd3b-4efc-88d7-e9befaae940c][Encryption]].

The analyst can *encrypt* one block of chosen =plaintext= with the targeted algorithm to get information about the *key*.

Once the analyst obtains the *key*, they can *decrypt* and use sensitive information.
