#+title: Prime Number


Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have exactly **two** distinct positive divisors: **1 and the number itself**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Indivisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
- The **first prime number** is 2, which is also the **only even prime**.
- Used extensively in **number theory**, **cryptography**, and **computer science**.

**Examples:**
- Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...
- Not Primes: 1 (only one divisor), 4 (divisible by 2), 9 (divisible by 3)

**Mathematical Definition:**
A number \( p \) is prime ⇔ \( \forall d \in \mathbb{N},\ d \mid p \Rightarrow (d = 1 \lor d = p) \)

**Applications:**
- Public-key encryption (e.g. RSA)
- Hash functions
- Random number generation
- Prime factorization
