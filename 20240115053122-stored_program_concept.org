* The stored program concept

The von Neumann model states that the [[id:899ca310-9704-46b5-9177-b2d76a875456][program]] must be stored in *memory*.

This is totally different from the architecture of early computers in which only the ~data~ was stored in *memory*:
the programs for their task were implemented by ~manipulating a set of switches~ or by ~changing the wiring system~.

The memory of modern computers hosts both a program and its corresponding data.

This implies that both the ~data~ and [[id:899ca310-9704-46b5-9177-b2d76a875456][programs]] should have the same format, because they are stored in *memory*.
In fact, they are stored as *binary* patterns in memory as a sequence of =zeroes= and =ones=.
