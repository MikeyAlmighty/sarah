The conversions shown are *transitive*.
(For example, an ~int~ can be directly converted to a ~double~ without first having to convert it to a ~long~ and a ~float~.)

* _Exam Trick_
** Casting Values vs. Variables
The second statement does *not* compile because ~hat~ is a *variable*, *not* a value, and both operands are =automatically= promoted to ~int~.
When working with =values=, the compiler *had enough information to determine the writer’s intent*.
When working with =variables=, though, there is ambiguity about how to proceed, so the compiler reports an *error*.

The third expression does not compile because =700= triggers an overflow for ~byte~, which has a maximum value of =127=.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
byte hat = 1;
short boots = 2 + hat; // DOES NOT COMPILE
byte gloves = 7 * 100; // DOES NOT COMPILE
#+END_SRC
