#+title: Anycast

Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single destination IP address is shared by devices (generally servers) in multiple locations.

Using =Anycast=, a computer can send a datagram to a specific IP, but could see it routed to one of many different actual destinations depending on a few factors.

This should also make it clear that there aren't really only 13 physical Root Name Servers anymore.

(It's better to think of them as 13 authorities that provide Root Name lookups As A Service.)
