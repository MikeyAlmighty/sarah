* Sequential Execution of Instructions

A program in the [[id:0dfb80a3-bb69-4347-a822-1227fece944a][von Neumann Model]] is made of a *finite number of instructions*.

In this model, the ~control unit~:
- *fetches* one instruction from ~memory~
- *decodes it*
- *Executes it*

The instructions are executed one after another.

*Sequential execution* of a program was the initial *requirement* of a computer based on the [[id:0dfb80a3-bb69-4347-a822-1227fece944a][von Neumann Model]].
