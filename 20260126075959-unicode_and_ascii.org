* Unicode and ASCII

Computers use ~binary~ numbers internally.

A [[id:8ec85e4d-ce23-471d-9afd-c9853ecae6fe][character]] is stored in a computer as a sequence of =0s= and =1s=.

Mapping a character to its binary representation is called *encoding*.

There are different ways to *encode* a =character=.

How =characters= are *encoded* is defined by an [[id:ef328551-cd74-449c-95c5-fef9ae9b7579][Encoding Scheme]].
