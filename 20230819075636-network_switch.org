#+title: Network Switch

A [[id:a6d3f0e4-6871-401d-acea-0a58e4b6891a][2. Data Link Layer]] device.

Originially known as a =Switching Hub=.


Networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to *receive* and *forward data* to the destination device.

A =switch= is very similar to a [[id:1e7fc195-38ea-4883-adce-ae3b728c0fe6][hub]], since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate.

A switch can actually *inspect* the contents of the [[id:514c3f0b-c3ec-46f1-aa28-c2a4874a6a7b][Ethernet]] protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for and then only send that data to that one system

(Leads to fewer retransmissions and a higher overall throughput, you're right.)
