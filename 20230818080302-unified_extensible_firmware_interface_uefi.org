#+title: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

=UEFI= performs the same function of starting your computer as a traditional [[id:de18822a-c4d8-4094-90d6-359ec6b87e83][BIOS]], but it's more modern and has better compatibility and support for new hardware.

Most hardware out there today comes with =UEFI= built in.

Eventually, UEFI will become the predominant [[id:de18822a-c4d8-4094-90d6-359ec6b87e83][BIOS]].
