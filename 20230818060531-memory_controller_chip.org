#+title: Memory Controller Chip (MCC)

The MCC is a *bridge* between the [[id:434b40ba-6fee-45ee-95e0-f8b79f751cdd][CPU]] and the [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]].

You can think of it like a nerve in your brain connecting to your memories, the =CPU= talks to the =MCC= and says "hey I need the instructions for step number three of this recipe", the =MCC= finds instructions for step number three in [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]], grabs the data and sends it through the [[id:33c77b2f-9280-4216-9aa9-78870c9f23c9][External Data Bus (EDB)]].

There's another bus that's nothing like a bus involved in the process called the [[id:ee6e611c-a910-4366-9bc6-358f8f5f6898][Address bus]].

Believe it or not, [[id:73ee7657-201d-4041-acfd-c05bdfaeb118][RAM]] is *not* the fastest way we can get more data to our CPU for processing.

The CPU also uses something known as [[id:229c7962-7536-4d73-ae79-837a3d35a5a4][CPU Cache]].
