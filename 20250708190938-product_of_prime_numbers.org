#+title: product of prime numbers

Every natural number greater than 1 can be expressed as a **product of prime numbers**.

This is the essence of **prime factorization**, a foundational concept in number theory.

**Definition:**
A number \( n > 1 \) is either **prime** or can be written uniquely (up to order) as a product of **prime numbers**:

\[
n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \dots \cdot p_k
\quad \text{where each } p_i \text{ is a prime}
\]

**Examples:**
- \( 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \)
- \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \)
- \( 30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \)

**Key Properties:**
- The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that every integer \( > 1 \) has a **unique** prime factorization (up to the order of the factors).
- Used in **GCD/LCM** calculations, **cryptography**, and **divisor functions**.
- Composite numbers have **multiple** prime factors; prime numbers have **only one** (themselves).
