#+title: Margaret Hamilton

17 August 1936 -

Margaret Hamilton was born in *1936*.

While working in the meteorology department at MIT, she developed software for predicting weather.

Later Hamilton would go on to work on the software that was used in the NASA Apollo command and lunar modules.

With her experience writing software, she wanted to ensure that this skill would get its due respect and coined the term “software engineering.”

Culminating her experience working on the Apollo missions and moon landings, Hamilton formalized what she learned into a theory that would later become the [[id:400569f9-cb7a-4332-97f6-88fa11bf185e][Universal System Language]].
