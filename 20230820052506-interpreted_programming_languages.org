#+title: Interpreted Programming Languages

Interpreted languages aren't compiled ahead-of-time.

A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a [[id:43735876-8513-4992-9216-2245154a9d04][Script]].

The script is run by an interpreter which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.
