#+title: Routing table

Set of rules, often viewed in table format, that's used to determine where data packets traveling over an [[id:9bf3b633-f396-4e1b-9b55-6c6b06d60bec][Internet Protocol (IP)]] network will be directed.

A basic routing table would have *4* columns:
1. Destination Network
2. Next Hop
3. Total Hops
4. Interface
