~Computer programs~, known as ~software~, are *instructions* that tell a computer *what* *to* *do*.

Computers do *not* understand =human languages=, so programs must be written in a language a computer can use.

There are hundreds of programming languages, and they were developed to make the programming process easier for =people=.

All programs must be converted into the instructions the computer can execute.
