* ~.toString()~

The ~Object~ class contains a ~toString()~ method that many classes provide custom implementations of.

(The ~StringBuilder~ class is one of these.)

Often ~StringBuilder~ is used internally for performance purposes, but the end result needs to be a ~String~.

** Example

For example, maybe it needs to be passed to another method that is expecting a ~String~.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
var sb = new StringBuilder("ABC");
String s = sb.toString();
System.out.println(s); // ABC
#+END_SRC
