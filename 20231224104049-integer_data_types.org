#+title: Integer Data Types

The default data type of an *integer* literal is always ~int~, but it can be specified as ~long~ by appending the suffix =L= (or =l=) to the integer value. i.e. ~2023L~

There is no direct way to specify a ~short~ or a ~byte~ literal.

* byte
Size: =8= =bits=
Range: =-128= to =127=
Use case: Useful for saving memory in large arrays where the range of values is small.

* short
Size: =16= =bits=
Range: =-32,768= to =32,767=
Use case: Used in situations where memory is a concern but a slightly larger range than ~byte~ is needed.

* int
Size: =32= =bits=
Range: -2³¹ to 2³¹-1
Use case: Most commonly used integer type for general-purpose numeric computations.

* long
Size: 64 bits
Range: -2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1
Use case: Used when a wider range of integers is needed, like for very large calculations.
