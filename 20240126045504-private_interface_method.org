#+title: Private Interface Method

* Private Interface Method

~private interface method~ and ~private static interface method~

Because both types of methods are ~private~, they can *only* be used in the ~interface~ declaration in *which they are declared*.
For this reason, they were added primarily to reduce code duplication.

** Private Interface Method Definition Rules
1. A ~private interface method~ must be marked with the ~private~ modifier and include a =method body=.
2. A ~private static interface method~ may be called by any method within the /interface definition/.
3. A ~private interface method~ may only be called by ~default~ and other ~private non­static methods~ within the /interface definition/.

- Another way to think of it is that a ~private interface method~ is only accessible to ~non-static methods~ defined *within* the ~interface~.

- A ~private static interface method~, on the other hand, can be accessed by any method in the interface.

For both types of ~private methods~, a ~class~ inheriting the interface *cannot* directly invoke them.
