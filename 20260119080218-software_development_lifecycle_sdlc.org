* Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The *Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)* is a structured process for planning, building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems.

It provides a shared mental model for teams to reduce risk, improve quality, and align technical work with business goals.

SDLC is not a single methodology—rather, it is a meta-framework that different models (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, DevOps) interpret differently.

* Summary

1. *Planning phase*: Suitable for roles requiring strategic thinking and business insight. Jobs include project manager, business analyst, and financial analyst.
2. *Requirements analysis phase*: A great match for individuals who excel in gathering and documenting requirements. Common roles are system analyst and requirements analyst.
3. *Design phase*: Attracts creative professionals like UI/UX designers, software architects, and database designers.
4. *Development phase*: The most coding-intensive phase, where software developers, frontend and backend developers, and possible mobile app developers thrive.
5. *Testing phase*: Focuses on quality assurance. That makes it a perfect match for QA engineers, test automation engineers, and security testers.
6. *Deployment phase*: Requires expertise in infrastructure and automation, with roles like DevOps engineers, system administrators, and cloud engineers.
7. *Maintenance phase*: Aims at sustaining the system over time, involving support engineers, maintenance engineers, and IT help desk specialists.



* Core Phases

** 1. Planning
- Define scope, constraints, and success criteria

*** Job Roles:

- *Project manager*: Oversees planning and resource allocation.
- *Business analyst*: Gathers and documents requirements.
- *Financial analyst*: Assesses the project's cost and ROI.

** 2. Requirements Analysis
- Collect detailed requirements from stakeholders.
- Analyse and document requirements in a software requirement specification (SRS).
- Address potential challenges or constraints.

*** Job Roles:
- *Requirements analyst*: Documents and manages system requirements.
- *System analyst*: Maps requirements to technical solutions.
- *Stakeholder coordinator*: Facilitates communication with clients.

** 3. Design
- Develop system architecture and high-level design (HLD).
- Create detailed designs for modules, interfaces, and databases.
- Prepare design specifications for developers.

*** Job Roles
- *UI/UX designer*: Designs user interfaces and user experiences.
- *Software architect*: Creates the software architecture.
- *Database designer*: Develops database models and structures.

** 4. Implementation (Development)
- Write code using programming languages.
- Perform unit testing for each module.
- Integrate individual components into the overall system.

*** Job Roles
- *Quality assurance (QA) engineer*: Tests the software for bugs.
- *Automation tester*: Writes test scripts for automation.
- *Performance tester*: Analyses system behaviour under load.

** 5. Testing & Verification
- Conduct functional, integration, and system testing.
- Perform performance, security, and usability testing.
- Fix issues and perform regression testing.

*** Job Roles
- *Quality assurance (QA) engineer*: Tests the software for bugs.
- *Automation tester*: Writes test scripts for automation.
- *Performance tester*: Analyses system behaviour under load.

** 6. Deployment
- Release software to the production environment.
- Monitor deployment for potential issues.
- Train users and provide user manuals.

*** Job Roles
- *DevOps engineer*: Manages deployment pipelines and CI/CD tools.
- *System administrator*: Oversees production environment setup.
- *IT support specialist*: Assists users during deployment.

** 7. Maintenance & Operations
- Fix bugs reported by users.
- Implement software updates and patches.
- Monitor system performance and scalability.

*** Job Roles
- *Support engineer*: Provides post-deployment support.
- *Maintenance engineer*: Handles bug fixes and updates.
- *System analyst*: Assesses changes required over time.



* Notes
- In practice, *SDLC* phases often overlap rather than occur sequentially.
- Modern teams treat *SDLC* as a ~continuous loop~ rather than a ~linear flow~.
