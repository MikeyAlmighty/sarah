#+title: Distance Vector Protocols

A [[id:88dd44ee-b7ff-4a29-9048-10709d05bb8e][router]] using a Distance Vector Protocol basically just takes its [[id:fc7b9829-4f49-4552-8c9a-cc483213d9f7][routing table]], which is a list of every network known to it and how far away these networks are in terms of hops.

Then the router sends this list to every neighboring router which is basically every router directly connected to it.


(They just have some information about their immediate neighbors)
