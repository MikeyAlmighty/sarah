#+title: NAND Gate

The NAND gate involves *two* input signals.

The NAND rule outputs an =OFF= signal only when both the inputs are =ON=.
Otherwise, the output signal will be =ON=

| INPUT A | INPUT B | OUTPUT |
|---------+---------+--------|
| ON      | OFF     | ON     |
| ON      | ON      | OFF    |
| OFF     | ON      | ON     |
| OFF     | OFF     | ON     |
