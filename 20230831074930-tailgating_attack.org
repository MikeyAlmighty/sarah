#+title: Tailgating attack

Gaining access into a restricted area or building following a real employee in.

In most corporate environments, building access is restricted through the use of a *key card*

A =tailgate= could use [[id:99c92f26-62e7-4d66-a978-87781d57e914][Social Engineering]] tactics to trick an employee into thinking that they're there for a legitimate reason, like doing maintenance on the building or delivering packages.

Once the tailgater is in, they have physical access to your corporate assets.
