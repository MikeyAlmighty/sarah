#+title: Identifiers

* Identifiers
*Identifiers* are the ~names~ that identify the elements such as =classes=, =methods=, and =variables= in a program.

** All identifiers must obey the following rules:
- An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of *letters*, *digits*, *underscores* (_), and *dollar* *signs* ($).
- An identifier *must* start with a *letter*, an *underscore* (_), or a *dollar* *sign* ($). It *cannot* start with a *digit*.
- Cannot be a [[id:8799def5-f75d-4933-9b5e-aabd642107c4][reserved word]].
- Can be of any length.

For example, ~$2~, ~ComputeArea~, ~area~, ~radius~, and ~print~ are *legal* identifiers, whereas ~2A~ and ~d+4~ are *not*.

The [[id:601d1a17-6f03-4138-9fef-1553f38794b8][Java Compiler]] detects illegal identifiers and reports *syntax* *errors*.

** Note
Since =Java= is *case* *sensitive*, ~area~, ~Area~, and ~AREA~ are all *different* identifiers.
