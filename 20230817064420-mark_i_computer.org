#+title: Mark I Computer

The Harvard Mark I, or *IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator*, was one of the earliest general-purpose electromechanical computers used in the war effort during the last part of World War II.

Mark I worked around the clock on military projects, calculating massive mathematical tables.

Principally it helped the Navy by computing tables for the design of equipment such as torpedos and underwater detection systems.

One of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on *29 March 1944* by [[id:eb84dd5c-fc6b-4c60-92cf-ca0bce1f215a][John von Neumann]].
