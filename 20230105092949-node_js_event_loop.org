#+title: Node.js Event Loop

JS has a single threaded runtime (Which means it has a single call stack) [One thing at a time].

Web APIs (Browser provided) or C++ APIs (Node.js V8 Engine provided)

Event loop works with a `Task queue`.

Event loops job: Look at the stack, only when stack is empty - dequeue from Task queue and push onto the Stack.
