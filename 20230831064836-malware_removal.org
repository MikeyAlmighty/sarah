* Remove malware

** Run an offline malware scan.

This scan helps find and remove the malware while the computer is still disconnected from the local network and internet.

All anti-virus/anti-malware programs rely on [[id:8f64f23e-666f-4105-9d14-283c535ac8f6][threat]] definition files to identify a [[id:31a54de4-592a-4ae3-bddb-fbdc67dbc47b][virus]] or [[id:28bfd4d2-9ece-4616-9f0a-666469384dbd][malware]].

These files are often updated automatically, but in the case of an infected computer they may be incomplete or unable to update.

To help ensure that a malware infection doesn’t happen again threat definitions should be set to update automatically, and to automatically scan for and quarantine suspected malware.

After the malware has been removed from the computer, you should turn back on the automatic backup tool and manually create a safe restore point.

If the computer needs attention in the future, this new restore point is confirmed safe and clean.
