#+title: Inheriting The Object Class

* Inheriting The Object Class

In Java, *all* classes inherit from a single class: ~java.lang.Object~, or ~Object~ for short.

Object is the *only* class that *doesn’t* have a =parent= class.

The key is that when Java sees you define a ~class~ that *doesn’t* =extend= another ~class~, the compiler *automatically* adds the syntax extends ~java.lang.Object~ to the class definition.

The result is that *every* ~class~ gains access to any *accessible methods* in the ~Object~ class.

** Example

For example, the ~toString()~ and ~equals()~ methods are available in ~Object~.

*** _Exam Trick_

On the other hand, when you define a new ~class~ that =extends= an existing ~class~, Java does *not* automatically extend the ~Object class~.
Since all =classes= inherit from ~Object~, extending an existing ~class~ means the child *already inherits* from ~Object~ by definition.
