* Turing Model

The idea of a *universal computational device* was first described by [[id:c09e8418-f6f7-40df-a932-719b682cd216][Alan Turing]] in =1936=.

He proposed that all computation could be performed by a special kind of a machine, now called a [[id:5a277bbe-5ff6-464c-b8d0-eb858f7179e3][Turing Machine]].

Although Turing presented a ~mathematical~ description of such a machine, he was more interested in the ~philosophical~ definition of computation than in building the actual machine.

He based the model on the actions that *people perform* when involved in ~computation~.

He abstracted these actions into a *model* for a computational machine
