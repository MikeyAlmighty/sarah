Devices that perform input and output: [[id:0c7c0297-9455-47d2-b8ad-22f7121769bb][I/O Devices]].

[[id:0c7c0297-9455-47d2-b8ad-22f7121769bb][I/O Devices]] are managed by our [[id:cba22c0a-759f-4b3a-9ee4-25663f8eb434][kernel]].

The [[id:cba22c0a-759f-4b3a-9ee4-25663f8eb434][kernel]] needs to be able to load up drivers that are used so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware.

When the [[id:cba22c0a-759f-4b3a-9ee4-25663f8eb434][kernel]] is able to start the drivers to communicate with hardware, it also manages the transfer of data in and out of the devices.

The [[id:cba22c0a-759f-4b3a-9ee4-25663f8eb434][kernel]] also handles all the *inter communication* between devices.

It also figures out what the most efficient method of transfer is and it tries its best to make sure our data doesn't have errors during process.
