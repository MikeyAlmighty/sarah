#+title: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

Used to determine when the communications channels are *clear* and when the device is *free to transmit* data.

If there's no data currently being transmitted on the network segment, a node will feel free to *send* data.

If it turns out that two or more computers end up trying to send data at the same time, the computers detect this collision and *stop* sending data.

Each device involved with the collision then waits a random interval of time before trying to send data again.

This random interval, helps to prevent all the computers involved in the collision from colliding again the next time they try to transmit anything.

When a network segment is a [[id:85e75571-71a6-4f6a-a1ef-7dff5e8f784d][collision domain]], it means that all devices on that segment receive all communication across the entire segment.
