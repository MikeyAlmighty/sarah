#+title: Observer Pattern

* Observer Pattern

[[https://github.com/MikeyAlmighty/design-patterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/src/main/java/org/designpatterns/structural/observer][Observer Pattern Implementation]]

The *Observer Pattern* defines a *one-to-many* dependency between objects so that when one object *changes state*, all of its *dependents* are *notified* and *updated automatically*.
(Can be either *Push* or *Pull*)

- There is a *Subject* and *Subscribers/Observers* for said *Subject*.
- When data in the *Subject* changes, the *Subscribers* are *notified*.
- The *Observers* are dependant on the *Subject*.


** Loose Coupling

- The only thing the *subject* knows about an *observer* is that it implements a certain interface (the *Observer interface*)
- We can add new *observers* at any time.
- We *never* need to modify the *subject* to add new types of *observers*.
- We can reuse *subjects* or *observers* *independently* of each other.
- *Changes* to either the *subject* or an *observer* will *not* affect the other.

** When to use

- When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes

** Negative

- *Subject* may send updates that don't matter to *Observers*.
