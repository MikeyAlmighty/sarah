#+title: Unary Numeric Promotion

- If the single operand is of type ~Byte~, ~Short~, ~Character~, or ~Integer~, it is *unboxed*.
    If the resulting value is narrower than ~int~, it is promoted to a value of type ~int~ by a *widening* conversion.
- Otherwise, if the single operand is of type ~Long~, ~Float~, or ~Double~, it is *unboxed*.
- Otherwise, if the single operand is of a type *narrower* than ~int~, its value is promoted to a value of type ~int~ by a *widening* conversion.
- Otherwise, the operand remains *unchanged*.

In other words, *Unary Numeric Promotion* results in an operand value that is either ~int~ or ~wider~.
