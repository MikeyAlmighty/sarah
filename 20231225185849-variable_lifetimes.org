#+title: Variable Lifetimes

The lifetime of a variable—that is, the time a variable is accessible during execution—is determined by the ~context~ in which it is declared.

* Instance variables:
The values of these variables at any given time constitute the state of the object.
Instance variables *exist as long as the object they belong* to is in use at ~runtime~.

* Static variables:
~Created~ when the class is *loaded at runtime* and exist as long as the class is *available* at ~runtime~.

* Local variables (also called method automatic variables):
Declared in ~methods~, ~constructors~, and ~blocks~, and created for each execution of the ~method~, ~constructor~, or ~block~.
After the execution of the ~method~, ~constructor~, or ~block~ completes, local variables are *no longer accessible*.
