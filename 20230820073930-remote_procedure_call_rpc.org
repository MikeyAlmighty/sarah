#+title: Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

When a computer program causes a *procedure* (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction.

That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.

This is a form of *client–server* interaction (*caller* is client, *executor* is server), typically implemented via a =request–response= message-passing system.
