#+title: Redeclaring private Methods

* Redeclaring private Methods

In Java, you *can’t override* ~private~ methods since they are *not* inherited.

Java allows you to *redeclare* a new method in the ~child~ class with the same or modified signature as the method in the parent ~class~.

This method in the ~child~ class is a separate and independent method, unrelated to the ~parent~ version’s method, so none of the rules for [[id:c67b24a4-82f7-4423-83a9-75fc1c566166][overriding methods]] is invoked.

** Example
These two declarations *compile*:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Beetle {
    private String getSize() {
        return "Undefined";
    }
}
public class RhinocerosBeetle extends Beetle {
    private int getSize() {
        return 5;
    }
}
#+END_SRC
