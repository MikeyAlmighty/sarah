- Bundle the data and methods that operate on the data in a single unit(object).

*Encapsulation* ensures that objects are *immune* to tampering except when manipulated through their ~public interface~.
*Encapsulation* exposes only what an object ~does~ and not ~how~ it does it, so that its implementation can be changed with minimal impact on its clients.
