* Shortening an =IPv6 address=:

1. Remove any leading zeros from a group.
2. Any number of consecutive groups composed of just zeros can be replaced with two colons =::=.

* Anatomy
NetworkID: First *64 bits*
HostID: Second *64 bits*

* Reserved Address Spaces
Documentation: Start with =2001:0db8=
If it starts with =FF00:xxx= [[id:c4309265-ff27-4592-85f6-3ed4ea47fc18][Multicast]]
If it starts with =FE80:xxx= [[id:4bb840ff-f8f4-472b-845b-597ebda44648][Link-Local Unicast]]
