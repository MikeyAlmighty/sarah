#+title: Liskov Substitution Principle

* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Introduced by Barbara Liskov

"*Subtypes* must be substitutable for their *base types* without altering the correctness of the program."

In simpler terms, this means that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

In other words, a *subclass* should be able to replace its *parent* class without any unexpected behavior.
