#+title: Type Conversions
#+property: header-args :tangle code/java/type_conversions.java

Some type conversions must be *explicitly* stated in the program, while others are performed *implicitly*.

Type conversions can be checked at *compile time* to guarantee their validity at *runtime*, while others will require an extra check at *runtime*.

* 1. Widening and Narrowing Primitive Conversions

** Widening Primitive Conversion

For the [[id:46582863-7f97-448d-bbc7-f7da4c1e7574][Primitive Types]], the value of a *narrower* data type can be converted to a value of a *wider* data type.
This is called a [[id:3ef23225-ae37-428e-8ad3-5d7728f59478][Widening Primitive Conversion]]

** Narrowing Primitive Conversion

Converting from a wider primitive type to a narrower primitive type is called a [[id:84dfb549-8f9a-4fc7-8fc0-6a20ca7bc0cc][Narrowing Primitive Conversion]]

*** Char Narrowing

Note that all conversions between ~char~ and the two [[id:2483364b-73d3-4169-92b9-1fea473a9b01][Integer Data Types]] ~byte~ and ~short~ are considered [[id:84dfb549-8f9a-4fc7-8fc0-6a20ca7bc0cc][Narrowing Primitive Conversion]].
The reason is that the conversions between the *unsigned* type ~char~ and the *signed* types ~byte~ and ~short~ can result in a loss of information.

These ~narrowing conversions~ are done in two steps:
- First converting the source value to the ~int~ type
- Then converting the ~int~ value to the ~target~ type


** Legality

It is *legal* to use a cast for a ~widening conversion~.

However, the [[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]] will flag any conversion that requires a ~cast~ if none has been specified.

Regardless of any loss of ~magnitude~ or ~precision~, widening and narrowing primitive conversions *never* result in a runtime exception.


* 2. Widening and Narrowing Reference Conversions

** [[id:37010aa8-20aa-40df-8e91-82c5f6476993][Widening Reference Conversion]]

#+BEGIN_SRC java
Object obj = "Upcast Me"; // Widening - Implicit
#+END_SRC


** [[id:58a81c47-6038-42ad-ba01-eb85e293884e][Narrowing Reference Conversion]]

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String casted = (String) obj; // Narrowing - requires cast
#+END_SRC

A ~subtype~ is a *narrower* type than its ~supertype~ in the sense that it is a specialization of its
~supertype~.


** Legality

[[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]] will *reject* casts that are *not* legal or will issue an *unchecked warning* under certain circumstances if type-safety cannot be guaranteed.

~Widening~ reference conversions do not require any runtime checks and *never* result in an exception during execution.

This is *not* the case for ~narrowing~ reference conversions, which require a runtime check and can throw a ~ClassCastException~ if the conversion is not legal.


* Boxing and Unboxing

** [[id:2af44b3c-ac25-4fc8-a372-20adc491f7f5][Unboxing]]
