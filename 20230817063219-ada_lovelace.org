#+title: Ada Lovelace

10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852

=Ada Lovelace= was born in 1815 to Anna Milbanke and the poet Lord Byron.
Her mother Anna Milbanke educated her to excel in mathematics.

When Lovelace was still young, she was shown the [[id:c835f120-2552-4c43-b7ef-13303b0841d8][Difference Engine]], and published a set of notes which contained the first computer algorithm for the Difference Engine in *1843*.

Lovelace posited at the time that computers would eventually be used outside of mathematics for things like composing music and made predictions about how technology would influence society.
