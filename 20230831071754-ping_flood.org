#+title: Ping Flood

(Type of [[id:075ef02e-9d9b-418d-be84-9ca16a1bd79f][DoS Attack]])

Sends tons of ping packets to a system.

More specifically, it sends [[id:511bcb87-0570-45a0-8e69-96efcbe1c78e][ICMP]] =Echo requests= since a ping expects an equal number of [[id:511bcb87-0570-45a0-8e69-96efcbe1c78e][ICMP]] =Echo replies=.

If a computer can't keep up with this, then it's prone to being overwhelmed and taken down.
