#+title: Ping of Death (pod)

(Type of [[id:075ef02e-9d9b-418d-be84-9ca16a1bd79f][DoS Attack]])

It works by sending a malformed ping to a computer.

The ping would be larger in size than what the [[id:9bf3b633-f396-4e1b-9b55-6c6b06d60bec][IP]] was made to handle.

So it results in a =buffer overflow=.

This can cause the system to crash and potentially allow the execution of [[id:a45c694a-df45-4905-a598-27ea6e3bda93][malicious]] code.
