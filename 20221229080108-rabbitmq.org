#+title: RabbitMQ

Solves problem where clients want to talk to another clients.

Instead of clients talking to some other client(s) (Ends up as spaghetti), RabbitMQ Server adds a intermediary [[id:e9e4b353-df8d-487d-b0e0-ba76b256912f][Message Broker]] layer.

Publisher establishes connection (bi-directional) using [[id:e8bde5c1-2b63-45d7-b636-c91b8a7ccf5d][AMQP]] to the RabbitMQ Server
Consumer establishes connection (bi-directional) using [[id:e8bde5c1-2b63-45d7-b636-c91b8a7ccf5d][AMQP]] to the RabbitMQ Server.

Server *pushes* messages to Consumer.

Channel - Connections within connection between Publisher to Server/Server to Consumer. (Multiplexing - bring a "lot" of stuff into one pipe.)
