#+title: SYN Flood (Half Open Attacks)

(Type of [[id:075ef02e-9d9b-418d-be84-9ca16a1bd79f][DoS Attack]])

Similar to  [[id:3d70b40f-449d-4794-b9b2-ea312ff134a9][Ping Flood]]

Remember that to make a [[id:690db04e-097b-4e6c-8e78-92e353fc49da][TCP]] connection, a client sends a =SYN= packet to a server, it wants to connect to next, the server sends back a =SYN-ACK- message.

Then the client sends an =ACK= message.

In a SYN flood, the server is being bombarded with these =SYN= packets.

The server is sending back =SYN-ACK= packets, but the attacker is not sending =ACK= messages.

This means that the connection stays open and is taking up the server's resources.

Other users will be unable to connect to the server, which is a big problem, since the TCP connection is half open we also refer to SYN floods as =half open attacks=.
