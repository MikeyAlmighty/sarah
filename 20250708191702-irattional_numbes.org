#+title: Irational Numbers

The set of irrational numbers is the set of all real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers (a fraction).

They have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal representations.

This set is often denoted as R \ Q or Q', representing the real numbers excluding the rational numbers.
