When they’re applied to =boolean= data types, they’re referred to as ~logical operators~.

Alternatively, when they’re applied to [[id:2483364b-73d3-4169-92b9-1fea473a9b01][numeric data types]], they’re referred to as ~bitwise operators~, as they perform *bitwise comparisons* of the bits that compose the number.
