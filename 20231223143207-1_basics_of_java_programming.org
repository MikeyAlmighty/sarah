* Exam Objectives
** Create classes and records,
** Define and use instance and static fields and methods
** Constructors, and instance and static initializers.


* Eco System
[[id:ca7ed5f6-ecc1-4661-a14f-9eb46dde14f1][Java Platforms]]

** Robust
The compiler guarantees runtime execution if the code compiles without errors.

Runtime index checks for arrays and strings, automatic garbage collection, and elimination of pointers are some of the features of Java that promote reliability.

* Terminology for ~Class Members~

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance Members  | The instance variables and instance methods of an object. members They can be accessed or invoked only through an object reference.                                                 |
| Instance Variable | A field that is allocated when the class is instantiated (i.e.,when an object of the class is created). Also called a non-static field or just a field when the context is obvious. |
| Instance method   | A method that belongs to an instance of the class. Objects of the same class share its implementation.                                                                              |
| Static Members    | The static variables and static methods of a class. They can be accessed or invoked either by using the class name or through an object reference.                                  |
| Static Variable   | A field that is allocated when the class is loaded. It belongs to the class, and not to any specific object of the class. Also called a static field or a class variable.           |
| Static Method     | A method that belongs to the class, and not to any object of the class. Also called a class method.                                                                                 |
