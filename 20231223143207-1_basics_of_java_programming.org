#+title: 1. Basics Of Java Programming
#+filetags: :OCP-17:

* Exam Objectives
** Create classes and records,
** Define and use instance and static fields and methods
** Constructors, and instance and static initializers.


* Eco System
[[id:ca7ed5f6-ecc1-4661-a14f-9eb46dde14f1][Java Platforms]]

** Robust
The compiler guarantees runtime execution if the code compiles without errors.

Runtime index checks for arrays and strings, automatic garbage collection, and elimination of pointers are some of the features of Java that promote reliability.

* Terminology for ~Class Members~

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance Members  | The instance variables and instance methods of an object. members They can be accessed or invoked only through an object reference.                                                 |
| Instance Variable | A field that is allocated when the class is instantiated (i.e.,when an object of the class is created). Also called a non-static field or just a field when the context is obvious. |
| Instance method   | A method that belongs to an instance of the class. Objects of the same class share its implementation.                                                                              |
| Static Members    | The static variables and static methods of a class. They can be accessed or invoked either by using the class name or through an object reference.                                  |
| Static Variable   | A field that is allocated when the class is loaded. It belongs to the class, and not to any specific object of the class. Also called a static field or a class variable.           |
| Static Method     | A method that belongs to the class, and not to any object of the class. Also called a class method.                                                                                 |

* Compiling
Compiled using the [[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]]

Each ~class~ declaration in a source file is compiled into a separate ~class file~, containing its Java bytecode.
The name of this file comprises the name of the class with ~.class~ as its extension.

Although a Java source file can contain more than one class declaration, [[id:d5b4004d-b5db-48a2-8e85-09359ca61a42][javac]] enforces the rule that there can *only be at the most* one class
in the source file that has ~public access~.

If there is a ~public class~ in the source file, the name of the source file must be the name of the public class
with ~.java~ as its extension.

In the absence of a public class in the source file, the name of the file can be arbitrary, but still with the ~.java~ extension.

* Running
It is the ~bytecode~ in the class files that is executed when a Java program is run—the source code is irrelevant in this regard.
A Java program is run by the Java Application Launcher, ~java~, which is also part of the JDK.
The ~java~ command creates an instance of the JVM that executes the bytecode.
