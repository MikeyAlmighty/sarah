#+title: Imports

* Imports

=Java= allows importing classes either *explicitly (specific imports)* or using a *wildcard (*)*.

Both affect *readability*, *maintainability*, and *clarity*.

** Specific Imports

Import *only* the required class.

#+begin_src java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
#+end_src

| Aspect        | Details                      |
|---------------+------------------------------|
| Readability   | Clear which classes are used |
| Maintainable  | Safe against package changes |
| Ambiguity     | No naming conflicts          |
| Best Practice | Recommended                  |

** Wildcard Imports

Import *all* public classes from a package.

#+begin_src java
import java.util.*;
#+end_src

| Aspect       | Details                  |
|--------------+--------------------------|
| Readability  | Less explicit            |
| Maintainable | Risky if package changes |
| Ambiguity    | Can cause name conflicts |
| Performance  | No runtime impact        |

** Note
The information for the =classes= in an *imported* package is not read in at ~compile time~ or ~runtime~ unless the class is *used* in the program.

The ~import~ statement simply tells the *compiler* where to locate the =classes=.

There is *no* performance difference between a *specific import* and a *wildcard import* declaration.

*** Why There Is No Runtime Performance Impact

- The [[id:601d1a17-6f03-4138-9fef-1553f38794b8][Java Compiler]] replaces *imported* =class= names with *fully qualified names*.
- The generated =.class= bytecode does *not* contain import statements.
- JVM class loading and execution are unaffected by how imports were written.
