The Decorator Pattern *attaches* additional responsibilities to an object *dynamically*.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- Decorators have the same *supertype* as the objects they decorate.
- You can use *one or more* decorators to wrap an object.
- Given that the decorator has the same supertype as the object it decorates, we can pass around a decorated object in place of the original (wrapped) object.
- The decorator adds its own behavior *before and/or after* delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.
- Objects can be decorated at any time, so we can decorate objects *dynamically at runtime* with as many decorators as we like.

** When to Use
- When you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses but you need to add functionality *dynamically* at *run-time*
- More flexible than inheritance
