#+title: External Data Bus (EDB)

Row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer.

When you send a voltage to one of the wires, we say the state of the wire is on represented by a =1=.

If there's no voltage then we say that the state is off represented by a =0=.

The EDB comes in different sizes:
- =8-bit=
- =16-bit=
- =32-bit=
- =64-bit=
