#+title: Factory Pattern

* Factory Pattern

[[https://github.com/MikeyAlmighty/design-patterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/src/main/java/org/designpatterns/creational/factory][Factory Method Pattern Implementation]]

** Factory Method Pattern

- Handles *object creation* and *encapsulates* it in a *subclass*.
- Decouples client code in the *superclass* from the object *creation* code in the *subclass*.

The *Factory Method* Pattern defines an *interface* for *creating an object*, but lets *subclasses* decide which class to instantiate.
(*Factory Method* lets a class *defer instantiation* to *subclasses*.)

Looking at the class diagram below, you can see that the abstract Creator class gives you an interface with a method for creating objects, also known as the “factory method.”

Any *other methods* implemented in the *abstract Creator* are written to operate on *products* produced by the factory method.

*Only subclasses* actually implement the factory method and create *products*.
