#+title: Turing Machine

Turing proved that there were some yes/no mathematical questions that could *never* be solved computationally which *defined computation and its limitations*.

These findings would go on to become one of the seeds of computer science and his conceptual Turing machine (so named by his Doctoral advisor) is considered a predecessor of modern computer programs.
