* The Interview Process

Interviewer will assess your performance based on:

- Analytical skills (How long spent on solving problem, How optimal solution).
- Coding skills
- Technical Knowledge
- Experience
- Culture fit (Communication skills)

Companies accept false negatives (Good candidates not getting an offer).
They fear false positives (bad candidate getting an offer).

There is no strict measurement/grading, it's **relative** to an interviewers opinion compared to how other candidates did.
