* Method Signature

A method signature, composed of the [[id:0b8acbe2-0b2b-4829-8aab-804dde49cabf][Method Name]] and [[id:94f7186e-22e8-4636-bc8c-a4cc040d9073][Parameter List]], is what Java uses to uniquely determine exactly which method you are attempting to call.

Once it determines /which/ method you are trying to call, it then determines if the call is /allowed/.

It’s important to note that the *names* of the =parameters= in the ~method signature~ are *not* used as part of a ~method signature~.

** Example

Despite having *different* =parameter= names, these two methods have the same ~signature~ and cannot be declared within the same class.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Not Okay
public class Trip {
    public void visitZoo(String name, int waitTime) {}
    public void visitZoo(String attraction, int rainFall) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
#+END_SRC

Changing the *order* of parameter types does allow the method to compile, though:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Okay
public class Trip {
    public void visitZoo(String name, int waitTime) {}
    public void visitZoo(int rainFall, String attraction) {}
}
#+END_SRC
