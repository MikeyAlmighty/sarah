#+title: Removing Whitespace

These methods remove *blank space* from the *beginning* and/or *end* of a ~String~.

* Strip and Trim

[[id:b48231a6-5283-4166-9a52-d08e00098c68][String.strip()]] and [[id:6dfae564-3cbc-4631-b830-6756ed217633][String.trim()]] methods *remove whitespace* from the *beginning and end* of a ~String~.

** _Exam Trick_

In terms of the exam, =whitespace= consists of:
- ~Spaces~
- =\t (tab)= characters
- =\n (newline)= characters
-  =\r (carriage return)= are also included in what gets *trimmed*.

The [[id:b48231a6-5283-4166-9a52-d08e00098c68][String.strip()]] method does everything that [[id:6dfae564-3cbc-4631-b830-6756ed217633][String.trim()]] does, but it (~strip~) supports *Unicode*.
