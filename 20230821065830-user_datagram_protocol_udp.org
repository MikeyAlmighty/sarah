#+title: User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

A [[id:562d2e3d-e271-41d4-8452-55a77a7a6642][Connectionless Protocol]]

=UDP= doesn't rely on connections and it doesn't even support the concept of an acknowledgement.

With =UDP=, you just set a destination port and send the packet.

By getting rid of all the overhead of TCP, you might actually be able to send higher quality video with UDP.

That's because you'll be saving more of the available bandwidth for actual data transfer instead of the overhead of establishing connections and acknowledging delivered data segments.
