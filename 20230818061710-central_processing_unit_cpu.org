#+title: Central Processing Unit (CPU)

Our =CPU= has an internal clock that keeps its operations in sync.

It connects to a special wire called a =clock wire=.

When you send or receive data, it sends a *voltage* to that =clock wire= to let the *CPU* know it can start doing calculations.

Think of our clock wires as the ticking of a clock, for every tick the CPU does one cycle of operations.

When you send a *voltage* to the clock wire it's referred to as a clock cycle.
