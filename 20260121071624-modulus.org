* Modulus

The =%= operator, known as *remainder*, yields the *remainder* after division.

The operand on the =left= is the *dividend*, and the operand on the =right= is the *divisor*.
~dividend % divisor~

Therefore, ~7 % 3~ yields =1=, ~3 % 7~ yields =3=, ~12 % 4~ yields =0=, ~26 % 8~ yields =2=, and ~20 % 13~ yields =7=.

** Negative numbers

The =%= operator can also be used with negative ~integers~ and ~floating-point~ values.
The *remainder* is *negative* only if the ~dividend~ is negative.

For example, ~-7 % 3~ yields =-1=, ~-12 % 4~ yields =0=, ~-26 % -8~ yields =-2=, and ~20 % -13~ yields =7=.

** UseCases
*Remainder* is very useful in programming.
For example, an *even* number ~% 2~ is *always* =0= and a positive *odd* number ~% 2~ is always =1=.

Thus, you can use this property to determine whether a number is *even* or *odd*.
