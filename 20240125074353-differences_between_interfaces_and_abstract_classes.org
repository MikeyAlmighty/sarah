* Differences between Interfaces and Abstract Classes

Even though [[id:3893ce2e-cd85-4914-ba26-d7c7c732eb02][abstract classes]]  and [[id:e1fb40df-c0b5-4c10-9704-39bac087c227][interfaces]] are both considered ~abstract types~, only ~interfaces~ make use of [[id:11cb5831-7123-44df-a020-cfd8f6646645][implicit modifiers]].

** Example

Both of these method definitions are considered ~abstract~.

That said, the Husky class will *not* compile if the ~play()~ method is not *marked* ~abstract~.

Whereas the method in the ~Poodle~ interface will compile *with or without* the ~abstract modifier~.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
abstract class Husky { // abstract required in class declaration
    abstract void play(); // abstract required in method declaration
}

interface Poodle { // abstract optional in interface declaration
    void play(); // abstract optional in method declaration
}
#+END_SRC
