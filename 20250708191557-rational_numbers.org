#+title: Rational numbers

The set of rational numbers, denoted by Q, includes all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not zero.

This set encompasses integers (which can be written as fractions with a denominator of 1), fractions, and decimals that either terminate or have a repeating pattern.
