#+title: Multicast

A multicast frame is similarly sent to all devices on the local network segment.

What's different to [[id:a983d5a3-cdfc-4c8c-98cb-a5656259506a][unicast]] is that it will be accepted or discarded by *each* device depending on criteria aside from their own hardware.

Network interfaces can be configured to accept lists of configured multicast addresses for these sorts of communications.
