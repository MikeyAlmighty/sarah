=GNU's not Unix.=

On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named [[id:5c736961-248d-489f-b58b-fe45b07b2e3a][Richard Stallman]] announced the plan to develop a free software [[id:aa65acf3-8a3f-4ce2-918f-975ff273faa7][Unix]]-like operating system called =GNU=.

=GNU= is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users' freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty years.

Since *1983*, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical replacement for proprietary [[id:1dcff204-74cf-445d-9357-5c01ca3d2a03][Operating Systems]].
