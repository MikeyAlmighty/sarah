#+title: Initialization Vector (IV)

Bit of random data that's integrated into the encryption key, and the resulting combined key is then used to encrypt the data.

The idea behind this is, if you have *one* =shared master key=, you then generate a *onetime* encryption key (Different each time it's encrypted).

That encryption key is used only *once* by generating a new key using the master one and the =IV=.
