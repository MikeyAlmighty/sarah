#+title: Amperage

The *amount* of electricity coming out as =current= or =amperage= (measured in amps).

We can think of =amps= as *pulling* electricity as opposed to [[id:ae273795-fd04-4e73-818a-29687c30aae9][voltage]], which *pushes* electricity.

=Amps= will pull as much electricity needed, but voltage will just give you everything.

Look on the back of one of your device chargers:

You might see something like *1A* or *2.1A*.

Charging a device with *2.1A* will actually charge faster because it's able to put *more current* from a *2.1A* than say a *1A* charger.
