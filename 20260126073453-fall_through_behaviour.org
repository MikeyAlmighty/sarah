#+title: Fall Through behaviour

* Fall Through Behaviour

The exam creators are fond of ~switch~ examples that are *missing* ~break~ statements!
When evaluating ~switch~ statements on the exam, *always* consider that multiple branches may be visited in a single execution.

Do not forget to use a ~break~ statement when one is needed.
Once a case is matched, the statements starting from the matched case are executed *until* a ~break~ statement or the *end* of the ~switch~ statement is reached.

** Example
For example, the following code displays =Weekday= for days =1–5= and =Weekend= for day =0= and day =6=.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
switch (day) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5: System.out.println(“Weekday"); break;
    case 0:
    case 6: System.out.println(“Weekend");
}
#+END_SRC
