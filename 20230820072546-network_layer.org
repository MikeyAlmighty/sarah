#+title: Network Layer

(aka =Internet Layer=)

It's this layer that allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.

[[id:3d086815-1bcb-4425-bb60-6b070bded421][internetwork]], the most famous of these being the *internet*.

While the [[id:a6d3f0e4-6871-401d-acea-0a58e4b6891a][2. Data Link Layer]] is responsible for *getting* data across a single link, the =Network Layer= is responsible for getting data delivered across a *collection* of networks.

The most common protocol used at this layer is: [[id:9bf3b633-f396-4e1b-9b55-6c6b06d60bec][Internet Protocol (IP)]]

Network software is usually divided into client and server categories with the client application initiating a request for data and the server software answering the request across the network.
