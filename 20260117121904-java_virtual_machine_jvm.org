#+title: Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

* Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

The JVM is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment that enables Java programs to be executed on any platform.

It acts as an abstract computing machine, translating Java bytecode into machine code that a computer's processor can understand.

This process is commonly referred to as "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) because the same Java program can run on any device with a compatible JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.

** Key features:

- *Platform independence*: *JVM* =abstracts= the underlying *hardware* and *OS*, allowing Java applications to run on any system with a compatible JVM.
- *Bytecode execution*: Java programs are *compiled* into ~bytecode~ by the ~Java Compiler (javac)~. The *JVM* interprets this bytecode at =runtime= and *executes* it.
- [[id:f2a08167-8ddf-4ce1-a02d-bcb9b75f3f2f][Just-in-time (JIT) compilation]]: Modern *JVMs* use a =JIT= compiler to convert *bytecode* into *native* *machine* *code* at =runtime=, optimising performance.
- *Memory management*: Includes *automatic* *memory* *management* through [[id:9ccc2e2b-e387-499a-aaef-790bb6c1caa3][garbage collection]], which *reclaims* *memory* used by objects that are *no* *longer* in use.
- *Security*: The JVM enforces security through features like the =ClassLoader= and the =bytecode= verifier, which ensure that only safe code is executed.
- *Multithreading* *support*: The *JVM* provides built-in support for *multithreaded* *programming*.

One of the most important components of the JVM is the [[id:f0752306-225a-4205-9ce8-5a27655db305][ClassLoader Subsystem]].

*** JVM Workflow
1. A Java source file (.java) is compiled into bytecode (.class) by the [[id:601d1a17-6f03-4138-9fef-1553f38794b8][Java Compiler]]:

   a. Navigate to the folder where Welcome.java is saved.
   b. Compile using:   ~javac Welcome.java~
   c. This generates a ~Welcome.class~ file (~bytecode~).

2. The JVM loads the bytecode via its ClassLoader.

3. The Execution Engine interprets or compiles the bytecode into machine instructions.

4. The program is *executed* on the =host= =machine=, with *memory* and *resources* managed by the [[id:04940e87-2f3a-4932-8467-375199bcac29][JVM]].

The *JVM* plays a pivotal role in Java's portability and popularity since it offers the so-called decoupling of Java applications from specific hardware and operating systems.
