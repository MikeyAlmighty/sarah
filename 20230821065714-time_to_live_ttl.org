#+title: Time To Live (TTL)

Every time a datagram reaches a new router, that router deck decrements the =TTL= field by one.

Once this value reaches zero, a router knows it doesn't have to forward the datagram any further.

The main purpose of this field is to make sure that when there's a miss configuration in routing that causes an endless loop, Datagrams don't spend all eternity trying to reach their destination.
